      "Be aware - spoilers ahead.Porgs are cool but The Last Jedi is not particularly good. It's better than say Attack of the Clones because it doesn't look like a video game but I don't get the reviews dubbing this as an intelligent movie because it managers to avoid any answers to any meaningful questions.It is really disappointing movie for somebody looking for answers to really anything Star Wars lore. It has some good fan moments but after The Force Awakens left viewers such a high-note with the return of Luke Skywalker - I left feeling empty and wondering if they just should have left it all alone.The legend of the rebellion and childhood hero for so many Luke Skywalker is a broken man who unfortunately has not learned too much in his time in exile despite tracking down the original Jedi temple, texts and scrolls he apparently hasn't read them or learned too much which I find completely puzzling and frustrating. He has no new revelations, we learn nothing new about the force from Master Skywalker who doesn't seem to be all that wise at all. I wanted something new, some new revelations about the nature of the force, the Jedi and how it began. Unfortunately we learn nothing here from the ultimate Jedi and its so frustrating. Don't get me wrong, we're treated to a great performance by Mark Hamill but I wanted Luke Skywalker to be great and wise and in the Last Jedi he just isn't. I mean at all. I'm all for the broken lone samurai type loner who is shamed but this is the hero of the original trilogy which is by far the moat revered and while Luke gets his redemptive moment, it merely serves to 'pass the torch' to the younger cast which is so contrived and obvious.I must admit I had really high hopes for this film. For nostalgic reasons and as much as I really liked the characters in The Force Awakens it's the original characters who we all fell in love with and seeing them treated like this is. A means to simply pass the torch to younger actors is really disappointing. The Force Awakens did it right with Han Solo because it elevated Kylo Ren's villain status enormously while this was just a generational hand-off for the sake of it.\n",
      "This is all made worse by the real-life and very tragic passing of Carrie Fisher who is back in her final performance. Just knowing she won't be there for the next episode stings even more so now after this one. The problem with this story is Rey and Luke are at it's center and the dynamic needed to be fleshed out way more to make her a worthy successor to Luke Skywalker and the question of her parentage is one of the most disappointing parts of this whole entire story. It is just such an unsatisfying answer and a massive wasted opportunity.More wasted opportunities lie with some of the characters. Supreme Leader Snoke's characters 'moment' was a shocking but ultimately empty. We got no backstory and nothing clever to bind the saga together. He is literally just a 'bad guy' that just appears out of nowhere and corrupts young Ben Solo, aka Kylo Ren. Captain Phasma is another throwaway character with nothing to do at all as is General Hux, who just provides comic relief. Are Disney doing this in purpose? The other twists and turns lie in the relationship between Kylo Ren and Rey which does manage to keep you guessing for a time as to where their allegiances will end up. Again both are really good in their roles but its not enough to save a lackluster story.Bright points are Carrie Fishers last performance. Oscar Isaac's ace pilot Poe Dameron is back and joined by Laura Dern playing newcomer Admiral Holdo. Their story and their interaction is one of the best side stories that completely pays off in a very Star Wars way. I loved Poe Dameron's energy and enthusiasm in this just like I loved Finn's in The Force Awakens. Unfortunately Finn's journey is far less compelling now. He is joined by actress Kelly Marie Tran who plays Rose Tico and a friendship/ possible romance ensues but it's all very cliche and nothing to write home about nor is the much-hyped Canto Bight scenes which resemble something more out of a Harry Potter movie than Star Wars. Though Benecio Del Toro's is good in his little role.Ultimately The Last Jedi is a lost opportunity to tie in the Skywalker story (aka the Star Wars story we all fell in love with) together in a satisfying package. I think Disney have tried to throw one too many curve balls this time around for curve ball sake and they're way off. Shocking twists are one thing but I remember leaving The Force Awakens with so much optimism and hope. I wish this were different but I feel robbed. Like there is no steam left in this story and nowhere else to go that I'd enjoy.\n",

The best movie since Empire Strikes Back some critics are claiming. So better than A New Hope? Not even close. It might be better than say Attack of the Clones because it doesn't look like a bad video game, the dialogue, acting and special effects are much better as they should be but I don't get the reviews citing this as an intelligent Star Wars movie because it manages to avoid any answers to any meaningful questions and when it does -- the answers are just so disappointing.

      "It's in the title and emblazoned all over the trailers; Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi master, declaring the need to end the Jedi order and bring balance to the Force. And for much of the film it looks as if it will keep this promise to explore the darker, twisted complexities of both light and dark side, and finally deliver a conflict that isn't merely the next generation of different coloured lightsabers clashing. That was one of the main criticisms of Abrams' revival, that we had seen it all before (and better). The Last Jedi barely allows any time to muse on the poignancies in the long gaze between the weathered face of Luke and his daughter (or so fans pleaded and speculated). Unceremoniously, he tosses the ancient weapon over his shoulder as if he was throwing out the trash. Immediately Rian Johnson signals a changing of the guard - there is to be no Obi Wan mentoring here, no Karate Kid style montages. Luke sees a deep pit of darkness within Rey, and for once it seems more than just vague menace and funny helmets. Yet ultimately it is a little too much to ask of the film to be brave with Rey - this is Disney property after all. Shame too, because Ridley is good enough to go there, by the look of her impulse and ferocity; see how she snarls and spits accusations at Kylo Ren before he can even get a word in, and furiously searches for the truth once aware of the discrepancies in the Jedi myths. The script affords the pair a good deal of time to explore their not-too-subtle duality as the two sides of the same coin through a neatly visualised psychic connection (the editing, with its seamless graphic match cuts and eyeline matches makes this simple but effective), but scurries back to its traditional legacies as if frightened of being too subversive of the most iconic film franchise of all time. Seeing the fan reaction over the opening weekend would confirm these fears. They'd rather have Rey be a next generation Skywalker than be forced to confront the uncomfortable truths of her abandonment as a child, or the failure of the original hero to wrest control of his force-sensitive underlings. There are scattered moments where you feel Rian Johnson is finally excavating the legendary mythos of the Jedi order and uncovering old lies; the force not as video game moves but as the entity that binds all of life together in a stunning and fleeting sequence reminiscent of those non-narrative mood poems such as Baraka, and a clever special effect that stretches the seconds both before and after Rey's present actions into an eternal stream. But right on the threshold of unearthing a game changer they regress back to how Star Wars has always been. If Del Toro's stuttering, double-edged space scoundrel has a point about the never-ending cycle of explosions and new model Death Stars, it falls on this chapter's deaf ears. There's little separating the two sides except the direction of the lasers - Johnson should have dug deeper or simply caved and given the fans what they wanted (a lightsaber extravaganza). It trickles down to the subplots too; Rose and Finn make a detour to cosmic Casablanca in Canto Bight, a gorgeous, otherworldly spectacle of cascading waterfalls and gold-tipped casinos (and just a hint of the Cantina theme), at least until Rose shatters the illusion with a bitter unveiling of the city's dubious origins. Most of the script's Marvel-esque quick wit lands with similar poise, an awkward bathos that elicits a few chuckles while the fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance. The most jarring moment comes when Rose's grand romantic declaration of \"saving those you love\" is immediately followed by the cannon demolishing the rebel base gate, with the emotional whiplash so exquisitely timed it almost belongs in a comedy sketch. I laughed out loud, although I know I shouldn't have. The film follows a long line of stylistically ugly digital filmmaking that can't always be compensated by the ability to will whatever exotic creature or fantastic biome into existence via CGI. I'm talking about those ridiculous long lenses and open apertures that force everything but the foreground into a blurry mess, squishing and distorting Hamill's face as he whispers into the ear of a meditating Rey (he's literally right beside her). Nearly every conversation needs to be boxed into a nauseating closeup, often cutting off chins or foreheads and negating much of the emotional anxiety conjured by Ridley and Driver (who does the most with the least - where exactly did this inner darkness come from, what lured him over? Will we ever find out?). Yet at the core of the film still lies that sense of wonder that captivated audiences that many decades ago. Could any other franchise elicit the audible 'woah' I heard in the theatre when the rebel ship activated hyperspace and threw a jagged arc of light across the screen? I've been pondering on what these new revival films ought to be. We're long past the grand theatrics and scope of the original space opera (ridiculous helmet is correct, Phasma can't sell it), and it can't be a galaxy far, far away with so much emotion and hope invested into the story. The final shot speaks to the child in all of us, harking back to a simpler time where a broom could be a blue lightsaber, and that meant you were the good guy. Perhaps we too should let the past die.\n",

      "The Last Jedi was a film with so much potential, but in the end it fell short of the mark with poor character motivations and unnecessary scenes. To say that The Last Jedi was bad would be wrong, I enjoyed large sections of it and found myself on the edge with many scenes, with well crafted suspense, and subversion of expectations, but it was deeply flawed as a film.Starting with the opening scene, within a minute we are thrown into an exchange between Kylo Ren and Poe Dameron which reaches cringeworthy levels of cheap humour, setting the tone for much of the rest of the film. Little lines of dialogue which had been reserved for just Finn as the comic relief in TFA now have been dished out to all the characters, with a particular stand out being a jarring line from Luke, during a heartfelt scene with Rey, undermining the entire scene and the connection forming between the two.Mark Hamill was quoted as saying that he fundamentally disagreed with Rhian Johnson's character choices for Luke, and whilst I enjoyed the moral struggle he toyed with, the character was quick to change his previously principled stance on not training Jedi, despite signs that Rey was seduced by the same dark forces that Kylo Ren was years earlier, with Luke even commenting on this not minutes before his change of heart. His rationale seems questionable at best. An appearance by bad CGI puppet yoda seemingly adds nothing to the film particularly, and after an exchange with Luke he disappears again, leaving you scratching your head as to why he was even there in the first place.Finn and Rose's daring plan which constitutes the middle third of the film sees them travel to a casino to find a master coder. Ah the casino, it somehow feels very George Lucas, the glitzy glamour, the sparkling clean setting, just waiting for a Jar Jar cameo as I get vivid prequel flashbacks. In a 2 1/2 hour film there is no need for any filler but this whole plot seems unnecessary and time wasting, when the plan eventually leads to nothing. There isn't any great character development and bar a brief cameo from a criminally underused character, Captain Phasma, the endeavours of Finn and Rose are actually mildly boring. The chemistry between the two never quite seems real, and much of the time their more emotional moments are subverted by BB8 providing unnecessary humour.A very touching moment came when Kylo Ren resisted the opportunity to kill his mother, adding to the moral dilemma which had troubled him in the previous film. However he forgot to notify his ensemble who still open fire on Leia and the rest of resistance high command, blasting them into the cold, inhospitable reaches of space. An abrupt but ultimately poignant end for Leia, and for the best, wrapping up the character before Carrie Fisher's untimely death in 2016. But nope! An alive Leia force pulls herself back into the ship in what might just be the most jarring scene of the film, which is saying something.Rey is drawn to Kylo Ren due to her belief that he can still be turned after a series of incredibly cinematic mind links. Upon arriving in Snoke's ship, Rey is escorted to him by Ren in a scene paying great homage to ROTJ, before arriving on the nicest looking Star Wars set, Snoke's room. After all the moral qualms we've seen Kylo battle with, it shouldn't be entirely surprising that he turns against Snoke and kills him, however to kill off the evil mastermind mid way through the second film is a very bold move and thus still catches you off guard. The subsequent fight between Snoke's guard and Rey and Kylo is magical, well choreographed, and set against stunning scenery. It was my favourite moment of the film. However quickly it becomes clear that Kylo and Rey want different things so after their little fling they have a bitter disagreement and break up.Snoke's death, while being a bold move, seems premature as absolutely no questions surrounding the characters were answered, clearly a highly skilled force user, but no more information given before he is cut down, and thanks to his death it seems that these questions probably won't be answers at all. The death paves the way for Kylo Ren to then be solidified as the chief antagonist of the trilogy, however this comes just as he sides with Rey and shows that his leanings aren't entirely black and white and he isn't an innately evil character. This poor character development then further confuses as by the final third he is once again an evil baddie, wanting to hunt down and kill every last resistance member. The final third sees our gang take on the first order on the ice planet of Hoth *edit* the salty planet of not Hoth. The spectacle is amazing and the stakes are high. Soon enough, Finn is moments away from sacrificing himself in a noble bid to save the resistance, but along comes Rose to stop him, almost killing herself in the process, and seemingly dooming the resistance. This \"heroic\" act doomed the lives of the resistance fighters and thus drives me to actively dislike Rose, Rhian Johnson totally failed with this, making it one of the bigger shortcomings of the filmLuke comes to the rescue, wearing what can only be described as your mothers poor attempt at a comicon Jedi robe, and after being fired on thousands of times and presumed dead, he emerges from the smoke and the dust, unharmed. A then underwhelming fight, especially given the previous one in the film, pits him against Kylo Ren, before it is revealed that he isn't actually there and it is merely a force projection. However, due to the mental toll of this, he becomes one with the force moments after, in a beautiful shot reminiscent of him looking out over the two moons of Tatooine. A beautiful end to the film.It isn't the end however, after brief moments with the resistance aboard the millennium falcon escaping, we cut to a young stable boy, who has the force, where he watches a space ship jump to hyperspace. *prequel Jedi youngling flashback* This unnecessary ending dampens the somber mood which has been created by Luke's death, and leaves me with a sour taste coming out of the film.Overall the film wasn't awful by any stretch, the acting was superb from Adam Driver and Mark Hamill in particular, but I would still ask questions about Daisy Ridley's slightly wooden performance. We got a brilliant lightsaber fight and some of the best space battles to date. There were major twists which I didn't see coming, and certainly no one could expect the film to flow the way it does.The entire middle third, focussing on getting the ship out of the way of the first order could've been cut down to reduce the run time, and some Finn and Rose moments could've been significant shortened, especially when their plan doesn't even work and only results in the first order realising the real resistance plan.I enjoyed to film, that isn't in question, however they missed the perfect opportunity to kill off Leia, they relied too heavily on cheap throwaway gags, many scenes were unnecessary, and character motivation seemed all over the place.With the death of Snoke, the first order just doesn't seem threatening in the same way as the empire, and thus at the conclusion of this film the resistance doesn't feel particularly threatened quite in the same way that the rebels did at the end of ESB, and it didn't feel like it was building up to a bigger finale all.For the pure enjoyment of it and the amazing scenes, it's possible to overlook much of the flaws, so I'd rate it a 6/10, on par with Rogue one but beneath TFA and the OT.\n",

      "The 8th chapter in the newly resurrected Star Wars series, is a rollercoaster of an adventure, filled with the unexpected fun, twist and turns that have been delightfully introduced by Rian Johnson. What you would expect is not what is given to you, in the most whimsical Star Wars film to date.Following from the end of the Force Awakens, we find Rey attempting to bring Luke Skywalker out of hiding to help the battle against the vicious First Order, but Skywalker himself does not seek to return, as his own past has defined him as he insists on staying in the dark. Meanwhile General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) leads the resistance in escape from the First Order in deep space, where Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Hux ( Domhnall Gleeson) won't rest till they are finally destroy them.As a life long Star Wars fan, it was regrettable when I went to see The Force Awakens two years ago, and coming out feeling very disappointed. After a couple more views, I have been able to enjoy the film, but still find several issues with it, that haven't made it the Star Wars film for me. I have to admit though that the ending, with reveal of Rey's power and that final appearance of Mark Hamil did have me anticipating in glee for the next chapter of the series. With a darker appearance than the previous film, and a different director: Rian Johnson, I have been very excited about the promise of The Last Jedi.As the caption \"A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away\" emerged I had a sudden shiver of joy (as did it last time). Unfortunately soon after, I found myself thinking its was going in the same direction of the Force Awakens, with the same issues occurring.We start with a rather choppy beginning in the establishment of our characters, that created a great disturbance in the balance of things. This was only pre-mature but stood out to ne. Again we have frequent moments of on the nose dialogue, that may sound good on paper, but through certain delivery is not. There is also have middle subplot with Finn (Jon Boyega) and new rebel character Rosa ( that doesn't really land on its feet and eventually becomes a waste of time just to fit into the 152 minute runtime.We furthermore have the return of the endless string of laugh out loud jokes and quirks that turn it almost into comedy, charming to some maybe, but not for this fan. Star Wars at its core is film about the struggle of good vs evil which I and I'm sure many fans take seriously, but its very hard to take it serious if the film isn't half the time. Its not just the cute humour with BB-8 but there are times during critical conversation, that it appears a custard pie has to be thrown. I know if you take any Marvel film you could pick out a hundred moments of humour, but there's something about the humour in the latest Star Wars films, which just ruins it for me, it pulls me out of this fantasy and draws attention to the artificial construction.That being said what Star Wars The Last Jedi wonderfully succeeds as a fun, action pack, adventure, character drama, and I am over joyed to say for myself, as a Star Wars film.A Bold and original take for the Star Wars series, The Last Jedi at last becomes its very own film, in a inventive war drama, taking you places you would never expect to find yourself. From a brilliant dramatic tension between, Rey and Luke, to Ren's desperation to prove himself to Supreme Leader Snoke, and the resistance struggling to work cooperatively against the First Order. This is mostly held together by Mark Hamill's stand out performance as the broken Jedi master, in his heart-rendering eyes and stares, Hamill, perfectly embodies an aging Skywalker, lost of hope for the rest of the galaxy. This is the key heart that drives the soul of the film. Furthermore Driver brings a much stronger an more powerful performance in Kylo Ren, especially when opposite his counterpart Rey, with Daisy Ridley also bringing a more thriving performance.Of course opposite Johnson's brialliant storytelling, is a range of fantastic action, including some sensational space dog fights, planet battles and as always exhilarating lighsaber battles. The Last Jedi, almost never rests in its continuous array of action making it one of the most action packed Star Wars films yet.What I wanted for The Force Awakens is exactly what I got in the Last Jedi with its own story, still with certain shouts to The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, but still a new chapter to remember. As also similar to last year's spin off film Rogue One, The Last Jedi, properly begins and ends with a monumental final third act This is where the new Star Wars era finally become Star Wars for me. The film represents the change and innovation which the filmmakers are presumably planning to bring into a new Star Wars generation.Star Wars The Last Jedi has now thankfully awakened the force in me, as to appreciate this new Star Wars era. It does still suffer from a several flaws within narrative structure, and my personal quarrels, but managed to bring out the real Star Wars fan in me. An incredible and enjoyable watch, The force is very strong with this one.\n",

      "Leaving the cinema after watching the Last Jedi, I was genuinely conflicted as to whether or not I enjoyed the film. In all fairness to Rian Johnson, he has carried the torch from J.J. Abrams with flying colours - with the feel and look of this new movie being constant with that of the Force Awakens. Despite this, along with the stunning visuals, epic fight scenes and (at times) brilliant character development, parts of the movie felt cheap and unfulfilling.I'll start with what I enjoyed - which was almost all of the film: my fears for this movie was that it would be too similar to the beloved the Empire Strikes Back, and would hold the same undermining criticism that the Force Awakens itself had. However, I can honestly say that this movie bucks the trend and establishes its own story - bringing characters old and new into the Star Wars Universe. Sure there may be a fight scene on an ice planet, a stab in the back by a likeable character (brilliantly realised by Benicio Del Torro) and extended training sequences; but these are culminated in an entirely new story with it's own twists and turns. Hamill, Driver and Ridley give stellar performances as their characters, with the mental connection between Rey and Ren being a particularly high point. The revelation of Rey's parentage, however controversial it may be, to me came as a refreshing change. Moreover, the reappearance of Yoda's force ghost was a welcome surprise - not only bringing audible laughs, but also progressing the plot in a meaningful way. Another personal favourite moment was the addition of the flashback to Kylo's betrayal of Luke, concluding in the fact that Luke wasn't so innocent after all. The cinematography and sound design of Holdo's suicide is absolutely breathtaking. And finally the force has been given the explanation it deserves. Luke's teachings of the force on Ahch-To is note perfect, dispelling all previous Midi-Chlorian nightmares.Now, there is one inexcusable error in this film and I was honestly bewildered watching it unfold. The handling of Supreme Leader Snoke in this film is diabolical. Out of all of the characters in the Force Awakens, he was who I was most curious about - who was this character? How did he seduce Kylo to the dark side of the force? What is the final stage of Kylo's training? Is Snoke a force wielder? The first time we see Snoke outside of his hologram in this film, it holds so much gravitas - he is superbly portrayed by Andy Serkis and fully realises the hype he was given after his first appearance. Snoke is presented as the most powerful force wielder we have seen in any Star Wars film; he can bridge minds across the galaxy, use FORCE LIGHTNING and fling people across the room like rag dolls with the tiniest motion of his fingers. All this culminates into a truly terrifying villain who we know both Luke, Rey and Kylo are no match for - I felt as though the revelation that he was Darth Plaguies was just around the corner. And with that - he was killed off.After approximately 10 to 15 minutes of screen time, the most powerful force wielder dies - without a backstory, not even allowing the audience to form any opinion on him other than \"ooh, he's so scary and ugly\". Not only is it insulting, it undermines the whole film meaning it doesn't feel complete. How did Snoke seduce Kylo? Where was Snoke during the original trilogy if he was so powerful? The questions remain, I can imagine now that already Disney have hired someone to write a Snoke backstory book or comic to respond to the films shortcomings. Aside from this, Luke's force hologram fight with Kylo did feel slightly cheap - however poetic and impactful Luke's death in the end actually was. As well as this, it almost feels as though Rey and Kylo's story arc is finished almost halfway through the film, after the lightsaber splitting scene.vIt feels as though the two characters should now be able to see far more eye to eye after the events of the film, but instead they revert to the regular dark side hates light side dynamic.All in all, I am looking forward to Episode 9 and the continuation of the Skywalker saga and whilst this film was thoroughly enjoyable - the issue of Snoke hangs over it like a dark cloud, keeping it from being as successful as it's original predecessors.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Here we go. Another year, another release of a highly anticipated Star Wars film. After last years solid, yet unspectacular \"Rogue One\", which was more of a spinoff prequel than anything else, many fans were anxiously awaiting the next main installment of the new trilogy. This second installment of the new trilogy, titled \"The Last Jedi\", directed by series newcomer Rian Johnson, comes with a ton of hype. As usual with highly anticipated releases, all the hype comes with the potential of disappointment, and unfortunately, The Last Jedi is a bit of a disappointment. The Last Jedi's story takes place right after the events of 2015's \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\". At the end of that movie, we see Rey (Daisy Ridley) finding legendary Jedi Master Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who is in exile on the planet of Ahch-To, and The Last Jedi picks up right from there. Rey's hope is to be trained in the ways of a jedi, but Luke is initially hesitant because of his previous experience of training a young Ben Solo, who became corrupted by the dark side and is now the evil Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). So, predictably, Luke is reluctant at the idea of training Rey, because of his distrust of her and people in general. Eventually, however, Luke decides to train Rey, knowing that Rey is perhaps the only hope the jedi have left in restoring peace to the galaxy. Meanwhile, the Resistance is in trouble. A First Order fleet led by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) has prompted the evacuation of their main base and Resistance fighters, led by pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and commanded by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) fight back to keep the Resistance alive. There is a lot going on in the movie, and it often switches back and forth between these two settings with other minor sub-plots getting some screen time as well. However, because there is so much going on, certain characters that we have come to care about are put on the back burner. For example, Finn was a major character in the first movie that had a good amount of character development, but here he's more of a secondary character mixed in a sub-plot with other minor, underdeveloped characters. That's one of the frustrations of The Last Jedi. Certain characters you feel like should have played a bigger part don't, and characters you don't really care about or that should have been side characters are now integral and main parts of the story. On top of that, certain characters that had the potential to be much more are either killed off or misused. There's one glaring example of this that I can't quite say as it would be a major spoiler. I can't help but think that Johnson decided to make these bold decisions just for the sake of doing something bold with Star Wars in an attempt to keep the series fresh. While it may have sounded like a good idea, all it really did was create loose ends that have no opportunity to be knotted up or answered in Episode 9. The Last Jedi establishes its overall pace right from the start. The opening space battle between the Resistance and the First Order is fast paced and action-packed, giving the audience a taste of what's to come in the rest of the movie. The action scenes are impressive and the visuals are beautiful, which makes this arguably the best looking Star Wars movie to date. While the action is impressive and for the most part engaging, there's almost too much of it and not enough of a break from it to give some time for character interaction and development. Aside from the parts with Luke and Rey, the movie is almost non-stop action and at 2 hours and 30 minutes, it gets a bit exhausting after a while. That's not to say that the film is too long, because it does justify its runtime, but the constant action for the most part gets tiring, especially during the last act. And although the film does chug along, there are certain points where it drags, especially during the casino scene in the middle act. Quite frankly, the pacing is a bit uneven.The Last Jedi does succeed in that it gives useful backstory and insight into certain events and ideas. One example is that it expands on our knowledge of the force and what exactly it is, which is was definitely a welcome addition. It also gives us some backstory of Ben Solo and how he eventually became corrupted by the dark side and became Kylo Ren. And throughout The Last Jedi, you get the sense that things aren't always what they seem to be, and this is only heightened by the several surprising twists and turns in the movie. No other Star Wars movie since \"The Empire Strikes Back\" has been able to pull that off, and The Last Jedi deserves credit for that.As expected, the acting in the movie is superb. Mark Hamill really stands out as an old and haunted Luke Skywalker, and he gives the performance of his career. Carrie Fisher is as good as ever as Leia Organa in her last role before her unfortunate passing. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are solid in their roles as Rey and Finn, respectively. Adam Driver returns as the evil Kylo Ren, reminding everyone why he can hold his own as the main bad guy. And of course there's the ever so great score by the legendary John Williams, who mixes in some of the classic score with some new material. All in all, what we have here is a decent, but underwhelming Star Wars film. It has its moments and it's obviously a must see if you're a Star Wars fan, but don't be surprised if you walk out of the theater feeling a bit disappointed, especially when it comes to the narrative department. Johnson obviously tried to do something bold with the Star Wars franchise, and I commend him for that, but the result is a movie that will probably divide the fan base even more over the direction of the series. Here's hoping JJ Abrams can help turn the tide around for the better in the next film.\n",

      "Star Wars has been an interesting ride since the Disney acquisition, mixing financial success with timid artistic expression. Thank George Lucas for creating a universe that is very hard to get right, and for personally demonstrate how horribly wrong it can all go when one strays too far from the winning formula of the original trilogy (by creating the lamentable prequel trilogy). Disney has struggled so far to tell a compelling new story while remaining on safe ground: episode VII captured the tone perfectly but felt like too much of a reboot in terms of plot, while Rogue One tried something new and got bogged down in a dour mood peppered with weird fan-service. Measured against those two offerings, The Last Jedi is another step in the right direction. It still contains a bit too much that is familiar, but, for the most part, succeeds best when it tries to be different.Plot-wise there is still a bit of confusion. Judging by our catch-up with Luke and Rey, we kick off the minute Force Awakens ended, but the opening crawl and action scene imply time has passed, mostly to the First Order's advantage (and on that front, there is still much confusion as to why there was a Resistance when there was a Republic, and why those resistance always allude to themselves as \"Rebels\"). From the opening seconds, though, it is clear that a new hand it as the wheel, and one soon understands why Disney seemed so impressed with director Rian Johnson's work here. The visual language is more poetic and effective than Abrams' anonymous work in VII and more appropriate to the universe than Gareth Edwards' more visceral experiment. Between a kamikaze jump to light-speed and Luke Skywalker showing us what a Star Wars Mexican standoff would look like, This is the first film in Lucas' galaxy far far away to carry images that will sear themselves into your retinae. The plot, in Disney fashion, tries to offer us comforting beats from Empire Strikes Back, our reference episode from the original saga, but, more often than not, this is to subvert our corresponding expectations. A grand second-act mission does not go as one would expect, and, thankfully, potentially groan-inducing revelations are either handled very well or, thankfully, simply do not occur. Not all is perfect, and this film specifically suffers from issues with the Great Disney Plan: clarity of context, as with the First Order thing, clarity with the villains, some of which, such as Snoke and particularly Phasma, do not register as hoped... But the new ingredients, particularly the new lead trio of Rey, Finn and Poe, are definitely winners. Daisy Ridley carries most of the film's emotion on what turn out to be very solid shoulders, while Oscar Isaac is given more to do this time around. In the baddie camp, we're still missing someone with the cold killer poise of Peter Cushing (the real one, not Rogue One's CGI abomination), but Adam Driver continues to knock it out of the park in unexpected ways as Kylo Ren. It is the kind of part that could have gone either way - and, in the hands of a Lucas directed Hayden Christensen, went truly bad - so kudos to Driver for making us care for his conflicted antagonist.Just as much of the early word on Episode VII was about a great return to form from Harrison Ford, so the internet has been on fire about Mark Hamill burning through the screen. I find the comparison unfair. While Ford merely tapped into that old magic - something he can do very well, admittedly - Hamill's turn as Skywalker here is something else. There are still deep, buried traces of the earnest farm-boy many of us grew up with, but when Master Skywalker decides to throw his weight in, Hamill unleashes a presence and charisma he had never hinted at previously, and it is a jaw-dropping joy to behold. The late Carrie Fisher also glows throughout, her gentle warmth giving the film a lot of its more touching moments.All in all, this might be looked back on as the one where the new generation of Star Wars films finally decided what they wanted to be, and which language they wanted to use. It does not reach the lofty heights of Empire, nor does it slavishly adhere to that classic's structure. In fact, it offers a cleaner ending, one that opens a fresh horizon with new, established and compelling characters. It will be intriguing to see what happens next.\n",

      "First off let me share my Star Wars fandom credentials: lifelong enthusiast and collector of all things Star Wars. I have every action figure ever made, I've read every expanded universe novel and all the comic books. I've watched every episode of The Clone Wars and Rebels. I can name any cantina character, quote any line, describe every scene down to the finest detail. I even love the prequel films if I force myself to ignore jar jar.Now on the movie:Incoherent. Preposterous. Ridiculous.There were some extraordinary missed opportunities that were one second within the director's reach.Kylo Ren murdering Leia like he murdered his father would have been a glorious death for her. Instead, some random tie fighter pilot blows her away but she survives the vacuum of space and floats back to a resistance ship. I almost walked out at that point. I just could not believe it. She has no further purpose.Last Jedi could have ended in a shocking way like ESB did, leaving us begging for ep 9. The moment Kylo Ren and Rey could have joined forces. Instead she retreats the same way Luke did in ESB. The story is all too predictable now.In Star Wars films some respect is usually given to plausibility and timing. But they have 18 hours to travel an untold number of light years to Monte Carlo (I can't even be bothered to google the name of the place), pick up a code breaker who apparently spends 24/7 at the craps tables, come back, and run some crazy heist. No. I refuse. Oh, and you need gravity to drop bombs btw. Ramming one of those bombers with full payload into the dreadknought would have been much more effective as well.Then there was the over the top attempt at humor. This is Star Wars, not Iron Man. The \"I'll hold\" bit went on for what, one minute? The \"who talks first?\" moment in ep 7 was okay but this is ridiculous.The director inhereted some truly awful characters from ep 7 and made them much, much worse. That is, Hux and Snoke.Hux is a horrible character. Over-the-top, not believable. Too young. Does not have the gravitas or silent menace of a Tarkin or the class and subtlety of any of the imperial officers in tos (think Admiral Piett.) He looks like he's barely concealing a laugh.I don't even know where to begin with Snoke. Who is this guy? Is he a Sith Lord? Where does he come from? Is he actually Darth Sidious resurrected? Is he Darth Plagueis? Where did he get the scars? Nothing is answered. He's just there to repeat some of Palpatine's lines but without any meaning. He's characterized as some omnipotent force wielder who can read Kylo Ren's mind. Yet he can't see Ren's little lightsaber trick? And the name is horrible, \"Snoke\" sounds like a little penguin. He looks like Gollum. I do appreciate he got Kylo Ren to lose the mask though. That's an acknowledgment that the mask was a mistake to begin with,Then there's the praetorian guards. Very cumbersome outfits. There's no way any non-force wilder should be anything other than lightsaber fodder for a force wielder. That these guys had Kylo Ren on the ropes is preposterous.Poe Dameron is just too good a pilot, and too reckless.BB-8 is cute but he makes R2-D2's achievements in AOTC look like nothing.Benicio del Toro's character is pointless. We get no time to get to him, we have no way of knowing who he is, what his motives are, and at what point did he get the opportunity to make a \"deal\"? Why would the First Order honor it anyway?Captain Phasma. Sigh. Complete waste, again.Luke is great but his magic trick at the end is just several orders of magnitude more powerful than anything any other Jedi has ever done. If he was capable of that, he should have been capable of taking down the entire First Order just by thinking about it. Maybe he just didn't feel like it.And I could go on and on and on. I'm not even going to see it a second time. I might wait for bluray for ep9. I usually see new Star Wars movies at least 5 times in the theaters.SHAME!!!!\n",

      "Like many here, I'm a long time Star Wars fan and a first time reviewer. This movie got me writing because it has so many things I want to say out loud.\n",
      "Here's some points that are not menitioned in every other review. So no wasted Snoke or Flying Leia -complaints here.\n",
      "And sorry for my possibly bad english.The good:\n",
      "The movie looks 95% of the time truly amazing. Cinematography is flawless. Actors are good. Soundtrack is good. Unlike TFA, the locations are now fresh. Dialogue and direction are good enough to keep you entertained. And this is why this movie gets so good ratings.The bad:\n",
      "The super long space chase has no logic at all. So, every ship of the Resistance and the First Order fleets are exactly as fast? Rebels aren't getting away, and the first order are not gaining on them at all. At the beginning of the chase TIE fighters are attacking the rebel fleet and causing some serious damage. Why did they stop the attacks?\n",
      "Generally, what do the Resistance want to do? -Send a message to all their allies. Why not use a UNTRACEABLE, smaller ship (what Finn and Rose use to travel to Canto Bight) to get few guys to salt planet or where ever and send the message? Or at least evacuate some of their passangers.\n",
      "Seems like the smaller ships are not a part of the chase: Falcon, Finn's and Rose's shuttles etc. all come and go to the Snoke's ship without a problem.Why are Snoke and Kylo Ren so obsessed with finding and killing Luke? He's gone exile, \"gone to die\", doesn't use the force anymore. He's basically good as dead. After Ray is caught Snoke shows off his power by telling he's gonna destroy the WHOLE ISLAND Really? Didn't First Order just blew away a bunch of planets like it was nothing.Half of the movie is about Rey and Luke on the island. I've seen the movie twice, and it's still hard to recall what were they talking about. Like their conversation doesn't lead anywhere. Rey asks Luke to help the Resistance. He refuses. Rey follows Luke around, Luke catches a big rubber fish... Somehow it all turns into some weird jedi training (that Rey didn't ask for). Actually, the whole training is about one sentence long: \"Reach out\". And now Luke goes from scared to super scared. Ray is wielding a stick and a light saber alone. Finally she cuts this one stone in half. Does this mean she's an exellent fighter now?Where is Chewie all this time? Sitting in the Falcon alone?\n",
      "Wasn't the island supposed to be some super secret hideout? Then, why is there this huge, ancient jedi temple and stuff, surely someone else would know this place.\n",
      "Why are the most sacred jedi books stored in a hollow tree? In a place were it's raining all the time?\n",
      "In the end, why are the books at Falcon? Did Rey stole them? That's a new jedi trick.\n",
      "When Rey and Kylo Ren first start to chat, Rey tries / wants to shoot him. That's ok, he's super evil and wants to kill everyone. But when Kylo tells that (also) Luke once tried kill him, Rey suddenly is turns to Kylo's side and attacks Luke.\n",
      "Luke looks like he's about to cry all the time. He's now a total mess because years ago one of his pupils turned to dark side. Really? It's the same guy who saw his family and friends die, fought Vader, Emperor and the whole empire for years. And won.In the end, the Resistance reach the salt planet. And then do what? They lock themselves to a cave just to wait for Fist Order to come and destroy them. They had some ships, why wait for the Falcon? The Resistance are devastated because nobody came to help them. Doesn't the Falcon count? Or Luke?There's no more wampas, minoks, banthas etc around. Now we have super cute puss-in-boots porgs, some beautiful tame horse-reindeer -things, and the worst: those crystal foxes. Ok, Disney could have made them all pink with a long hair and a perfect singing voice. That might sell even more toys.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Well, as they say, all good things must come to an end. Before I get into my review I will say this, I am a HUGE Star Wars fan, whilst Rogue 1 and TFA were not perfect, they had that Star Wars feel, this does not. It genuinely breaks my heart to have to say this, but I hated a Star Wars movie, I spent most of the movie trying to convince myself it was ok. In the 3-4 hours I've had since leaving that hope has gone and I'm bitter. Here goes:1. The overall story is trash, it's centred around the lamest concept ever. A literal crawl through space whilst we wait for them to run out of fuel... seriously. Who the f**k thought that should be the grand centrepiece for a SW film.2. The \"subplot\". It's the most pointless, contrived piece of s**t I've ever seen. They go to a casino planet, sounds cool right? Could be some cool aliens, right? Could see some cool space gambling, right? No. It's a casino. Have you seen Las Vegas, its that, with less f**king freaks. Why do they go there? To find a code breaker, on the word of Maz Kanata. Poe gambles the last of the resistance on finding some random guy by his lapel pin on the word of a terribly CGI-ed Maz. Ok. The worst of all, besides the rest of the s**t that happens on the planet (which is both numerous and terrible) it's all completely pointless. They don't achieve their objective and if they did, it wouldn't have mattered anyway because the resistance already had a plan, they just don't like sharing... 0/10, worst SW storyline ever.3. Everybodies a nobody. Member Snoke, yeah he's no one. Member Rey, yeah she's no one. Member Finn, yeah he's no one. The porgs are more fleshed out characters than half the t**ts in this film. The less said on Snoke the better. 4. The First Order. The biggest bunch of losers, led by the king of the Ls. Seriously, these guys are the most inept bunch of morons in cinema history. Kylo has no credibility because he constantly loses, he's pathetic. Unless the end of the final film is him killing Rey and ruling the galaxy then he's pointless. He's lost more times to her than Luke's had weird green titty milk. The FO Stormtroopers are so so so bad. They cannot do anything well. Captain Phasma is like Boba Fetts simple cousin, another member of the First Order suck fest.5. New force powers. Apparently the force can now allow you to survive in space, fly about like iron man and make realistic holograms of yourself.There's tons more s**t so I'm going to rattle some more off:\n"

      "Overall a very good movie. Non spoiler review first: 1/3 of the comedy didn't sit well. The casino felt very not Star Wars and was off putting. The action was great, beyond great, spectacular! The the Luke, Rey, Kylo dynamics were incredible... very excellent writing and acting. The story was really good, I like where they are going with everything and how it is fresh material. SPOILERS BELOW:SPOILERS\n",
      "SPOILERS \n",
      "SPOILERSLet's get the gripes out of the way first. They didn't overshadow the movie, but as a HUGE Star Wars fan (originals), things that aren't right must be pointed out. To nitpick, a few of the comedic turns didn't sit well with me, especially the phone call piece early on in the movie. But a lot of the humor past the 30 minute mark worked for me, so it's all fine I say. My biggest gripes on the comedy are: a. Don't use very modern phrases in space opera movies. 20 years ago people did not have cell phones, so that lingo just screams \"the years 2000's and up\". b. I think they shouldn't turn Hux into a complete idiot from a cartoon; he might be rabid but he can't be a complete idiot and be in that role... keep him more scary I say. c. I was OK with the cute factor of the Porgs... not my favorite thing, but I can deal with it. But if you are going to have cute style animals for comedy or kids, stick with the cute factor and see it through. Don't have good guys eat them or have them nearly kill themselves. That is just messed up... what the hell, did the movie makers love Porgs or hate them? Or was it purely for critics to \"get\", because critics are grownups and can't handle cutsie kid stuff, so there needed to be an underlying disdain for them? There certainly were tons of critic pandering in this movie, not that I am complaining for most of it, but this is one spot that it bothered me a lot. I do have kids, and if you want to put cute fluffy stuff in a movie, don't show them being skinned and cooked by my kids' other favorite character(s). And then Chewie and the Porgs become buddies. Where the Porgs begging for meat or making Chewie feel bad for eating them? None of that &^%$ made sense. I won't attempt to overthink possible PETA and gun rights messages... I love animals, but I do eat meat, OK, I believe in \"if you kill it, it is honorable if you use that to continue to live, it is dishonorable to kill for only sport\". The animal cruelty message worked well enough with the fathiers, I'm down with that. The Porg stuff... no it didn't work for me at all. d. Luke was a little weird. For one he seemed a little too flippant about his old saber. Throwing it over the shoulder... meh, kinda weird. It could have been worse I guess. The milk scene... also kinda weird. e. BB-8's disguise... um, no. That wouldn't fool anybody would it? OK, biggest gripe: The Casino. It was not Star Wars. Too much CGI on the buildings. And inside it just looked like a real casino on Earth, I didn't buy it at all. Also, the way the aliens were portrayed, they looked too human or something. It just didn't sit well with me at all. The stuff with the animals and the kids on that world were fine by me, I get it. The CGI with the fathiers was distracting only during the run, but somewhat tolerable. They looked cool when in the stables. Tauntauns were more unique, but fathiers looked pretty cool. Second to last gripe, shouldn't Rey require some kind of training? Some kind... just a little? What does she get, 2-4 days with Luke? It seems incorrect, so you just have to accept it... she's some serious prodigy. One final gripe, Kylo's helmet. Oh dear lord, I mean what if Vader hadn't had his helmet on for 2 of the 3 movies? It would have been awful; he would have lost that mystique and scare factor. So Adam Driver is a great actor, no doubt, and he can do more without that helmet. OK, ... but to completely destroy the helmet and most of what drove him to be sort of \"OK\" with the dark side, following Vader? No. And mostly, the helmet just looks great. We need it back, he should rebuild one for episode VIX!!!!!! He doesn't have to wear it nonstop. Please?!?!---Now for the good stuff---The action and visuals. Oh my goodness, the action. The Kylo and Rey scene towards the end was just so awesome to behold! Was it the best fight scene in any Star Wars movie? Probably! The Holdo scene... wow, just wow. The Luke and Kylo scene... yeah yeah yeah, it was stellar! SPOILERS, yeah I noticed Luke's beard was no longer white at all, and didn't figure he dyed it, but still I had no clue what was really going on till the reveal. Cool, and just how powerful is Luke, huh? Badass. The walker + speeder visuals were beautiful, just beautiful. And I was totally down with the Rose \"crash\"... what a nice change/surprise! The acting. All the supporting roles were great, loved the new characters, loved 'em! Rose and Holdo especially stood out as interesting. While some say it's impossible for Luke, Mr. Hopeful, to have been so negative... if you accept it was possible for something like that to happen, you will enjoy one of his best performances ever.The story. Loved it. Loved how they kept you guessing (so did the critics it seems, I figured that). Loved that part with Snoke... I am not a \"read all online theories before the movie and get upset when my favorite theory doesn't pan out\", so your mileage may vary. I had avoided all that speculation as much as I could. Loved how Kylo keeps flip flopping, ... Adam Driver makes that very believable. I could go on, but I must run. Go see this movie! I need to rewatch it ASAP!\n",

      "I've never been disappointed like this in a Star Wars movie before. Even the prequels... sure, too much of that dialogue was poorly written, too much of the acting was poor, and then there was Jar Jar... but the story was still rich. The Last Jedi is somewhat the opposite of the prequels in that way. The Force Awakens was mostly great in a lot of ways, even tho it had some big flaws I was willing to overlook (like the oversized Death Star ripoff able to suck on a sun and spit out a single blast that impossibly spreads out to magically destroy multiple planetary targets, and some other stuff). But, this one now... Good Grief! Where do I start? I want to split points out into positives and negatives, but too many of those points sorta fall into both categories; like the comedy. I laughed. It was funny. But, maybe a little too funny. I don't want to judge it too harshly for that. Then there's the too-obvious girl power angle thrust into the whole thing. I don't want to sound anti-girl by any means, because I'm not, but it's getting ridiculous. For Star Wars. And it's distracting. Traditionally, Star Wars was historically a boy's movie, generally speaking, and that was always a little sad for me because I always found it hard to relate to anybody who didn't love Star Wars (relationships have gone south over this), so I am somewhat glad the series has boosted the female appeal, especially since I have two daughters. But they're trying too hard. That purple haired lady couldn't die off nearly fast enough for me; way too much of her and her confusing useless distraction. I love the character of Rey (she's awesome). I like Rose. But, the character of Phasma, for example, is totally useless to the story. Just Disney trying to do what it does best: making more money by any means possible. And that last phrase could basically sum up what I think they're doing with Star Wars. Just enough fan service to keep the loyal old base (like me) coming back for more, and then a whole lot of other junk to get everybody else's money that George Lucas didn't capture previously.Going into the show knowing Carrie Fisher (God bless her beautiful soul) is no longer with us, I kept looking for her end to come in the story. And it was equal to watching that first Southpark Christmas episode, waiting for Kenny to die, watching him approach several deadly situations that turned out to be nothing, and he lives past the end of the show. There were so many opportunities to work Leia's death into this movie, but she just keeps going on and still lives, character wise. What the heck are they gonna do now? We still don't know who the heck Snoke is, or was. And that's kind of a vitally important question needing to be answered. I guess I can live with Rey's origins turning out worthless (assuming Ben spoke truly) but it's a pretty big let down, and it doesn't feel natural. I don't believe that was originally intended. Then there's Luke. The last hope (for this trilogy). What he became was pretty weak for our greatest hero, and it just ain't right. And what the heck happened at the end? He really couldn't have been physically present for the big showdown? And now he's dead. He was the best part of the movie, even if they did cheapen his character... he was still the best thing this movie had going for it. And now I have to ask myself: will I go and see the next one? or cut short my losses and just try to forget this movie ever happened. Chances are, I will have to see for myself how this ends, like it or not. I just hope the professional critics are pleased with all the money they clearly got paid for their rave reviews to hype it up for Disney. And I hope even more that Disney will pay attention to all the real reviews by the real fans that matter and do their best to fix this tremendous mess up for the next one.\n",

      "The character of Luke Skywalker is so clearly developed in the original trilogy. He shows up to help his friends and family when in need, no matter what and at any cost. He repeatedly makes selfless, morally sound decisions. He sees goodness in people when nobody else does, even in Darth Vader. To now portray him as a cynical, sarcastic, grumpy old hermit who had it cross his mind to murder his nephew in his sleep (he sensed darkness!) and then isolate himself on an island \"to die\" and avoid cleaning up the mess he made of his nephew makes no sense, even with the flashback explanation given. The same goes for Jedi. Their awesome power lies in cool force abilities and light sabers - ONLY on a SUPERFICIAL level. What really distinguishes a Jedi and makes those characters magical and awesome is their certain noble way of being - that is calm, courageous, and clear-minded in any situation. Despite the movie's title, there is no Jedi to be seen in this film.As for the \"baddies,\" we have two incompetent, bickering rage-a-holics left in Hux and Ren. They are sure good at screaming. Despite Adam Driver's jaw-dropping talent, the Kylo Ren character's primary traits remain confusion and rage. He has no clear direction and thus no real power, no intimidating presence. He's an unsympathetic crybaby and he's going to lose every time, as he has until now.There is so much confusion in the characters overall - and just as much at the end of this second movie as in the beginning. It's likely a reflection of the way the trilogy is being pieced together with multiple writers and no real collaboration between them in creating the characters and story arcs. Rey, Luke, Ren, Poe, Finn... great characters who have no idea what they want in this mess. Snoke, Holdo, and Leia were the most powerful, driven characters in the movie and the only ones who weren't confused at all... alas, those ships have sailed.There were some other aspects to the film that were less than ideal storytelling, or didn't feel right in a Star Wars film, but honestly, I can let everything else slide. The nonsensical discarding of Luke, the Jedi, and the Force had me walking out of the theater feeling tired, hollow and sad, even though I enjoyed and was entertained by many parts of the movie. This movie truly \"lets the past die, kills it if it must.\" It takes us down a glittery new beautiful CGI path with awesome twists, effects, and the sights and sounds of Star Wars but missing the heart and soul of it. That's a path I'm not really interested in following.\n",

      "I can't believe how profoundly disappointed I was in this film. After allowing it to ruminate for a little while, I've decided to write this review from two aspects: One as a film in general, the other as an eternal Star Wars fan. As a movie, this was an incredible failure on a scale far greater than other installments (Attack of the Clones is remembered fondly after seeing this). I can't blame the actors and actresses, and in fact, I am quite a fan of them. They are probably the only good part of this project. It would be like blaming a messenger for what they delivered. What Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy created is in no way quality cinema. Characters were so poorly developed that both their names and roles are hard to remember: While I love Laura Dern, I'm not entirely sure what her characters purpose was, aside from slightly snide remarks to our hero, Poe; Rose (?) I think was the name of Kelly Tran's character, a poorly written, yet major portion of the storyline, she has some form of slave background and emotional ties to a sister we know nothing about, as well as holding an amulet made of something that does nothing other than conduct electricity; Supreme leader Snoke is never explored, explained, or in any way built upon from the previous film, and is ended in such a hilariously anti-climactic way I actually laughed out loud; Benicio del Toro plays a strange mix of his character from Snatch and the Collector from the Marvel Universe, and does literally nothing of value. Rey, Finn, and Poe get no profound treatments, with Rey receiving incredibly lame news about her genealogy. The killed Luke, who is now a big cry baby rather than former saviour of the galaxy, and let Leia live? Leia also becomes Mary Poppins in one of the saddest scenes ever made for Star Wars; yes, far worse than Darth Vader's 'Nooooo' from episode 3. Several scenes were clonal remakes of the old trilogy, in rapid summative succession they are: Reys meeting of Snoke, mirroring Luke and Palpatine; At-At type walkers on a desolate white surfaced planet, attacking a large wall, just as in Empire, except they make the distinction that it is salt and not snow (Ha); Luke and Rey running around an isolated planet just like Yoda and Luke, including an underwater X-wing (Thankfully, they don't go as far as raising it); A remake of Mos Eisley spaceport (again)(including a plain English rehash of Sir Alec Guinness's famous scum and villainy line, said by Rose). The list goes on. Annoying, constant comic relief in the form of awful CGI creatures (Porgs?) made me want to return to the time of the Gungans. The tragic pace of the movie formed by droning dialogue and superfluous landscape shots makes you aware of the full 152-minute run time of the film. You're left with the realization that the movie progressed nothing at all, and it literally ends the exact same way it began: Rebels running from Imperials. As a fan, a person who has expended much capital on Star Wars merchandise, and a lover of sci-fi, this is a horrid abomination for the once fantastic Star Wars universe. Once a rock-solid bastion of great storytelling (except the prequels), richly developed locations and characters, and a seemingly never-ending depth of possibility, the Star Wars universe is now a gross, warped Disney monstrosity. The movie played out like a childish episode of Star Wars Rebels. A single x-wing destroying all external cannons on a dreadnought, a single bomber destroying said dreadnought, four rebel ships fleeing without the other first order ships firing a shot, and the continued puttering, foolish tact and strategy employed by the First Order, makes you disbelieve that this faction could ever control the galaxy much less develop super weapons. Why is the First Order fleet slowly chasing down a cruiser, firing pot shots and picking off transports one ship at a time? Why wouldn't a few of these ships simply jump in front of the rebels and cut them off? Why is fuel suddenly a concern? Why wouldn't the rebels jump their smaller ships into the First order fleet instead of letting them get run down and destroyed? Why are villains still terribly monologuing?! Snoke is super powerful but can't sense (Or notice) a lightsaber rotating directly beside his hand? I can type for days but It just makes me more and more confused, saddened and disappointed.\n",
      "Anyways, save your money, it'll be on Netflix by May the Fourth. I couldn't possibly cover all the issues here and I'm already rambling too much. So, that is my review, this movie is essentially the Battlefront 2 of Star Wars movies. Until Disney can make a good film, I would suggest not paying for more Star Wars shlock.\n",

      "TL;DR\n",
      "Comparable to TESB, but still differentAll parts of plot substantial and interestingFlicking between storylines emphasises the film's long runtimeExciting questions posed in the last film given underwhelming answersSeveral surprises you won't expect Plenty of references to older filmsLots of comedy - perhaps too much?New planets are imaginative - particularly the final planetIncredible fight and battle scenes - Star Wars action at its bestCharacters new and old are important to the storyWhen it was announced that Disney would be buying Star Wars and adding more films, there was widespread fear and moaning on the internet. However, Disney found our lack of faith disturbing and our doubts were suitably crushed. But what now? Can lightning strike twice and can Rian Johnson pull off something as wonderful as J.J. Abrams? The answer is a resounding yes.TFA has often been compared to ANH, where there are a number of striking similarities. Therefore it's long been assumed that TLJ would continue along a similar vein, being alike to TESB. However, whilst there are certainly similar aspects, TLJ is a very different beast to TESB. Now we know the characters, the plot is split in 3 parts, much like TESB was split in two. But neither of these storylines feels like a \"side-quest.\" Instead they all feel like substantial parts of the film, keeping the story fresh and engaging, coming together perfectly.One minor issue with flicking back and forth is it emphasises the films long length of 2 Â½ hours. Whilst the pace never feels slow or boring, its skipping from one story to the next does make you realise the long run-time. But when it's so enjoyable it's hard to care. On top of this, not much has really changed. Whereas sequels should take the overarching plot further than the first, not much is different and it feels as though some significant plot point is lacking. Additionally there were some potentially big, exciting questions posed in the preceding film which are wasted, some great potential just being thrown away, almost as if this film doesn't want to be included in the overarching narrative.Also every blockbuster now insists on including so many comic moments it becomes a quasi-comedy. On one hand, the comedy in TLJ is very funny and it adds a fun characteristic to the movie's personality. On the other hand, it verges on overstaying its welcome, occasionally going a gag too far.Still, we do get to explore more planets. The world of Star Wars is a big one with unlimited potential and part of the original joy was seeing things we'd never seen before. With CGI as incredible as it is these days this challenge is becoming harder, yet the creativity of Star Wars' galaxy still taps into our imagination. It's safe to say that Las Vegas will soon see a Star Wars-y element to it. Luke's planet is also a lot more fleshed out and not as barren or boring as it could have been. After all, who doesn't want to run away to an island populated by those adorable Porgs?! The final planet we find ourselves on is stunning. A thin layer of what looks like snow hiding a mass of deep red salt that, when disturbed, goes flying into the air, a gorgeous rich burgundy cloud of dust floating around, contrasting with the pure white ground - an incredible backdrop for a thrilling climactic battle. This is the sort of look we really need and want from the Star Wars sequel trilogy. The CGI in the prequel trilogy made that galaxy look very different to the original. What the sequel trilogy excels at is faithfully continuing the look and feel of the original trilogy whilst subtly updating it to feel more authentic. It's a joy to see that along with the references to the originals to revel in the nostalgia; yet the message it also gives is a good one - especially for a beloved franchise transforming to suit the modern day (for better or worse); namely it's fine to look back fondly and smile, but it's important to be able to move on and look to the future...The newer films certainly improve on action scenes. Take any space battle or light sabre fight you want from this film; they're all thrilling, edge-of-your-seat stuff, giving you a big enough adrenaline rush to boost you into hyperspace. TLJ shows us Star Wars action at its finest; quick, fun, kinetic, explosive, acrobatic. It's all wonderfully varied, excellently choreographed, seamlessly performed and beautifully scored, with the returning John Williams remaining the biggest behind-the-scenes hero of the Star Wars films.The biggest bridge between trilogies is the characters. We have a pleasant mix of classic and new characters. The original characters are still highlights, with many an audience incapable of giving a cheer when they see Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, R2-D2... and yes, even C-3PO. They don't appear just as cameos though; these characters bridge the gap between films and are crowd pleasers (along with all the nostalgic references and appearances), but more than that they are genuinely included within the story as substantial roles. This isn't just a brand new trilogy, but the use of these characters show it's an expansion of the Star Wars saga, emphasising how this is one continuous story. However we see a different Luke Skywalker here than before. Still time has passed since ROTJ and it's important for characters to progress... Their inclusion of Carrie Fisher's General Leia was done very well (apart from one particular strange scene in space) and often felt like a fitting tribute.The new characters can stand proudly among the classics. Rey and Finn come back, each leading their own storylines confidently, both developing their characters; Ridley going from naÃ¯ve to more confident, and Boyega as always being a consistent to joy to watch. Hux get more time on-screen to shine and uses that time well, establishing his character much more. Kylo Ren goes deeper and brings out the conflicted nature of his character effortlessly, showing us the real danger is how we can never trust him. Serkis could have been a memorable antagonist, but isn't given the chance. Newcomers Del Toro, Dern and Tran all put their own unique touch on the franchise, Tran's Rose in particular lending a personal, more human touch that gives us pause to think and reflect on our own world. The best character change is Isaac's Poe. A stand-out character from TFA, he's given more screen-time, his electric energy permeating his scenes. Then there's BB8, who, while not used as frequently, still steals the scenes he's in.Star Wars: The Last Jedi has proved to be a divisive entry in the franchise. This came as a surprise to me as I came out of the cinema with a huge smile on my face. While it may suffer from a long run-time, thrown-away plot-points and maybe a bit too much comedy, TLJ is excellent and enjoyable. Big, bold and exciting with brilliant characters, shocking story developments and beautiful action scenes, this is the Star Wars film we needed.\n",

      "Love or hate Disney and the direction they have taken with all of your beloved childhood favorites (or Lord, what are they going to do to The Simpsons?!?!!?), they are the company everyone else is looking up to. They have 5 of the 10 highest-grossing movies in cinema history, the highest-grossing American film of all-time, and in the year 2017 own 4 of the 10 most successful films globally-and this is with Star Wars and perhaps even Coco making its way towards the top. They have their crap figured out in an era where Hollywood is struggling to go up against indie cinema, Netflix, digital streaming, and the YouTube generation of sheer creativity, incredible access to the past, and overanalyzation.Point is: Disney has a plan, they always have a plan to beat and defy the odds. Disney hardly missteps and when they do, it's because they become arrogant or take too big a risk. They are basically the Golden State Warriors of American entertainment, they are their own worst enemy. All this must be remembered when viewing The Last Jedi, because this film has Disney's psychotic blueprints all over it, even in the midst of all the risks they clearly take in the eighth installment of the beloved and slightly polarizing franchise. The Last Jedi is a visual feast, a dramatic work that will flood the fanbase with controversial decisions, and overall yet another step in the right direction for a franchise that was sputtering just a decade ago. Disney has indeed made treasure out of trash, and has given an intense breath of life to a series that has spanned five different decades-from film to comics and books.This span hinders the current trilogy more than anything. In the real world, people age, people die (look at what happened to the Harry Potter and Matrix series after key actors passed), unexpected twists and turns occur, and screenplay decisions sometimes has to bounce off what is happening once the cameras stop rolling. The Last Jedi is most definitely affected by Carrie Fisher's passing, the aging of multiple actors, the sheer amount of time and scope since it all began, and of course a legion of hungry yet hesitant fans that have been collected in different generations, leading to differing views on where Star Wars has been and where it should go. This movie is great, yet polarizing. It will have its enemies and defectors, and Disney doesn't care.To say I agree with all the events of The Last Jedi is inaccurate, but nonetheless within the 150+ minutes there's a passion, a magic that cannot be explained. The camerawork, the soundtrack, the visual effects are top-notch and keeps in line with the Star Wars look and feel. Rian Johnson's take on Star Wars mixes the same formula with a few unique quirks and some subtle and not-so-subtle contemporary commentary on the way the world (or in this case, universe) works. The dialogue isn't as wooden, and the characters aren't as one-dimensional as what we're used to in Star Wars. The original trilogy in the midst of all its greatness was pretty darn black-and-white. Just like in The Force Awakens and especially Rogue One, The Last Jedi doesn't operate this way. From Rey to Luke to Kylo Ren, their motives and emotions constantly shift and develop.The story in the eighth installment is actually much more grounded than the previous films, as it mainly involves a race against time as the First Order is inches away from fully destroying a small Resistance group led by Leia that is desperately just trying to escape the clutches from the overpowering legion of enemy ships. At the same time, Rey is trying to figure out her place while also attempting to convince Luke Skywalker to join the tiring fight that seems to be tilting heavily towards the First Order. The Last Jedi is a mental and physical race, as everyone is running out of time, patience, options, and most importantly hope. The theme of hope in a cruel world is very much prevalent here, much like in Rogue One.All your favorite characters from The Force Awakens returns, even though some are very short on screentime (because your entourage of questions and hunger for more content will lead to book sales for Disney; and yes they are evil). I assure you, some of you will walk out disappointed in the lack of focus on some. And yet no matter how lengthy the build-up feels, the payoffs were consistently gratifying, and then we have cameos left and right tossed in for good measure. There was plenty of action and different locales, but we needed more. There was plenty of interaction between the new school and the old school, but we needed more. The Last Jedi felt like a main course that was plentiful, yet left you hungry for more. And if you think this is an accident, then you are missing the entire picture. Disney (once again) prevents one of their films from going truly mad and absolutely crazy, once again not all the cards are left on the table. This was the biggest problem with Force Awakens, and other massive Disney blockbuster movies like Age of Ultron, Civil War, and especially Dead Man's Chest (which just missed being an all-time blockbuster masterpiece)-just a cinematic tapping of the brakes. You see three movies making up a trilogy, Disney sees seven through nine as three episodes of a massive television series, each with their cliffhangers to keep you thirsty and desperate for resolution and answers.Force Awakens was the salad and drink, just to start the process. The Last Jedi, as enjoyable as it was, definitely felt like the hearty appetizer leading to a (hopefully outstanding) main course that we won't receive until 2019. You can disagree with this direction, as even Empire Strikes Back didn't quite feel this empty by the final frame. But, this is the current system of Disney filmmaking and as long as they keep getting top-tier talent to produce top-quality content in a current age of cinema that can become frustratingly dry in large sections, this is a formula that will not change.The Last Jedi is quality from a filmmaking and production standpoint. From music to cinematography to directing, this film is no slouch and is even deserving of some Oscar nominations (although lack of screentime really hurts the outstanding Adam Driver and even Mark Hamill from theirs). However, this movie will upset fans, especially some of the old-school fans guaranteed. Personally to me Star Wars has become so big that we each have our interpretation of the franchise. This is why only some love the prequels (those poor souls), why only some enjoy the Clone Wars series, only some enjoy the current films, and why only some will truly hate this film. Putting on the fandom hat, I definitely expected and hoped for something different, and might need a second viewing to digest it all. Taking off the fandom hat, I can't deny the fact that aspiring big budget filmmakers and movie studios need to see this as an example of great storytelling, pacing, and a genuine care of the main characters--exactly how Disney wanted.\n",

      "Okay. So I went to see \"The Last Jedi\" a second time to get it all straight in my head. Noticed some more details that were easy to miss the first time, such as more consistency (but also some more inconsistency) in the overall intent of the movie.The big point of the movie clearly seems to be to transfer the heroic agency from the Jedi to the Resistance. The normal men and women (and slave children) of the Resistance are the true heroes, and will rise to glory in the next movie (where sympathizers from hundreds of systems will no doubt heed the call, accidentally delayed, no doubt, only by a small hyperspace traffic jam), rebuilding the movement, aided by Rey and maybe a few more appropriately humble Force users on the sidelines.I continue to disagree with almost all aspects of the underlying philosophy of this movie, however, which has the depth of sage American high school instruction along the lines of \"Pessimism is like a glass half empty! Optimism is like a glass half full!! Whoa, that's so profound!!\" What we see so painfully clearly in \"The Last Jedi\" is a philosophical position regenerated in many American movies: that, given the choice between saving the lives of a large group of people who are not your personal loved ones, and the lives of one or two of the people closest to you, you should always and absolutely just save the few people (or the one) closest to you. Which is, of course (as Mr. Spock knows), WRONG. It proceeds from the bourgeois sphere of empathy which only includes your immediate family and friends. A true hero's sphere of empathy and understanding of human worth include ALL people equally; he does not make exceptions for those who happen to be his intimates.This tendency reaches its most visible zenith in the scene where Rose kisses Finn while the portal to the rebel base explodes in the background. \"Let's be selfish and perhaps even aroused while the people we were supposed to save die horribly in the distance.\" This is one of the most anti-heroic scenes of all time! It made me cringe, feel pain and go \"Ew!\" But it gets far worse: Luke's entire position in this movie is just another version of the same thing! Because he felt called upon to (almost) sacrifice one of his own intimates (his nephew, Ben Solo, for good reason), his reaction was to leave the rest of the galaxy in the lurch, rejecting his responsibility (and, initially, natural inclination) to help the Resistance against The First Order. He stopped caring about the many people who depended on him because of a traumatic experience with one person close to him. Which is weak and unheroic. As Mark Hamill knows, Luke Skywalker wouldn't behave like that on his worst day.Now, stay with me for this next bit of Johnson logic. Rian Johnson's view (as perpetuated by Luke in the new movie) is that the Jedi are to blame for the rise of the Sith in the older movies. Like, the Jedi were not heroic *enough*; they failed ONCE after a stable 1000-year reign of the Republic, and this suddenly makes them vain and unworthy of their special status. BUT, these movies are also very much about the prophecy of the balance of the Force. The breaking in half of Luke's light-saber clearly shows that Kylo and Rey's powers are precisely equal. There can be no doubt that they will enter into a balance, a state of harmony (with the help of the Force Ghost of Luke), at the end of the next movie. Which all means that the Force guides people's destiny. Otherwise there couldn't be a prophecy which came true. If there are destinies, there can't be much free will. If there is no free will, then the Jedi cannot be blamed for the rise of the Sith. It's all just down to the Force balancing itself. So it's inconsistent logic to blame the Jedi. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE JEDI. Hence, Luke (and especially Yoda - talk about \"shits and giggles\"!) is behaving wildly out of character in this movie.Then, to specifically examine the progressive value in this movie, let's look at the societies of the Star Wars galaxy. When the Jedi were great symbols of heroism, the nature of the societies didn't greatly matter to the artistic substance of the story. Because if great heroes win the day, the implication is that society will be reborn according to heroic morals. And in the old movies it was easy to interpret the Empire as the equivalent to our local imperialist hegemony: the exact capitalist society in which we live (which was also Lucas' original intentions, as per the Rebel Alliance being conceived as the Vietnamese of the Vietnam War). But if the heroes are just normal representatives of the given society, then their victory only implies the victory of that society's values. Therefore, the nature of the narrative's fictional society matters a great deal to the progressive content of the story. There are three types of society and concomitant values: right-wing, center and left-wing. Corresponding to: Slave economy (fascism and racism, now mostly belonging to our historical past), bourgeois merchant rule (current capitalism and profiteering) and classless, moneyless democracy (the heroic humanism that will emerge in the future).Proper heroes, in order to be in any way progressively anti-establishment and provide role models for how we should evolve socially in the future, can only represent the last of these. But in a Star Wars universe without classic Jedi, the only society that the Resistance has any chance of achieving is the middle kind: the centrist, capitalist one. They live in a society where a slave economy still reigns in many places, and presumably/hopefully a new Republic would do away with that, but it is very clear from this movie in particular (but in fact also from Lucas' own prequels, in which it was established that the Jedi-run Republic's society was really just normal current-style bourgeois democracy and capitalism, which is inconsistent with the progressive symbolism of the original trilogy), that everything takes place on a capitalist premise. The biggest army belongs to those with the biggest pocketbooks: Good guys and bad guys equally exist on the premise of a monetary society.Hence, the progressive level of this franchise can penetrate no further than to the level of centrism; it can never cross over into truly progressive (left, anti-capitalist, heroic) territory. It is thoroughly establishmentarianist, just like Disney, and can never be anything else, no matter how much it focuses on the \"little people\"; the slaves and workers and common folk. The story aspires only towards the end of slavery, and the attainment of current-style capitalist democracy (which is not genuine democracy but a heinous means of manipulating the ignorant masses) and is not anti-authoritarian at all.These conventions also identify the franchise as entirely fantasy, now dispensing with any lingering pretentions to being science fiction. I hate that; I preferred looking at Star Wars as science fiction, since science fiction is always and inherently far more progressive than fantasy.Conclusion: Since there is nothing progressive about the movies that follow the original SW trilogy, there is no artistic substance to speak of, either. Nothing to root for if you are a progressive - besides the sheer visual spectacle, that is, which is indeed magnificent.I will emend my initial 2/10 rating of \"The Last Jedi\" to a subtly higher 3/10 because of the visual splendor, and because the movie, after all, gives us much to discuss. But one thing is certain: it truly is a soulless commercial product, intended, in the absolute main, to get bums on seats and keeping them transfixed with empty-calorie bread and circus. Bad, bad movies. But at least they are interesting to discuss - until, of course, the novelty of this, too, wears off.\n",

      "There are two was to look at this film. One, as a standalone film that has nothing to do with anything and two, as a film that assumes to shoulder the responsibility of thirty plus years of history, fandom and anticipation.As a film it's convoluted with no real coherent plot or point. You have zero time to actually feel or care about the characters as they just move along from scene to scene, moment to moment without any real cohesion. One minute Poe is getting escorted off the bridge by the purple haired Admiral's guards, the next he is standing in front of her having a nice chat moments before committing mutiny.Rose and Finn are entirely throwaway characters that add nothing to the over all story. How a former janitor is able to defeat the highly trained, and skilled Storm Trooper Captain Phasma is beyond belief. However as most have come accept as believable is that anyone can come to the fight without any prior training and win, just because they believe.Rose on the other hand, valiantly \"saves\" Finn from himself as he is about to sacrifice hisself in order to save the remaining rebellion from destruction, because she suddenly finds herself in love with him for no real reason whatsoever.Snoke, while having had a great deal of potential to be interesting was little more than another CGI villain, who met a quick end by the hand of Emo Darth Vader.It took me a while to reconcile what I was seeing, but the best way I can describe most of the movie is that it was more like going to an Anime or Star Wars convention where everyone is dressing up as their favorite characters and playing caricatures of someone else.As a Star Wars Film, it was a complete and utter travesty. Some have compared the unfavorable reviews to the unfavorable reviews that Empire had received in 1980. At the least, you could say that the negative reviews then were more shocked at the darker nature of the film, although the film stayed within it's nature. Others have argued that it's mostly angry white men hating on the film, but seeing as how it the crowd that I was with consisted with two men (including myself), and three women, there was no one who had anything positive to say about what was seen, and the general consensus was that it was Star Wars in name only and lacked any of the depth or understanding of the actual universe or characters.Kylo Ren continues to be an Emo Sith Lord, who ironically is the only one who suggests to Rey that perhaps they could team up and do something different other than be a Jedi or Sith. Of course Rey, who we also find to be no one or nothing of any relevance, aligns herself with the Jedi (or Luke Skywalker) for some reason or another. To be sure, there is no real reason why she would have any attachment to anyone as there is simply no development as to why she should care in any capacity.Luke is now a curmudgeon who just endlessly wallows in self-pity and instead of being the wise old, warrior sage that we had all waited 30 years for, instead turns out to be a weak, cowardly, broken man who maunders around his island, milking four breasted sea monsters for blue milk.Leia can apparently survive the vacuum of space and NOT kill everyone on the ship as she opens the door from the outside to let herself back in after getting blown out by an explosion, and Yoda can affect the corporeal world by summoning lightning and burning down trees.I'm thoroughly convinced now that Disney is bent on vandalizing the institution of Star Wars to make a point. I find it hard to believe that a multi-billion dollar company could screw up a movie that badly, however here we are. The truth is that it wasn't a good film. Sure there was a very cool scene where The Admiral plows her ship through the First Order Fleet at light speed, but otherwise this movie was little more than CGI cut scenes, explosions, and space ships. To it's detriment, it tried to sprinkle on some philosophy and metaphysics, however such things are way beyond it's pay grade, though it might sound deep and meaningful if all you ever read are young adult novels, or watch nothing but anime...And I mean the newer anime, not the older anime that was in no way meant for children....As an institution Star Wars is dead. It might be good for the fans looking for little more than a sticker slapped on a plastic box, but for those that want something to sink their teeth into, there are about 30 years worth of books that actually tell a proper sci-fi story. It was about 45 minutes too long and watching Chewbacca suddenly decide not to eat a Porgie (after capturing, killing, skinning and cooking one over the fire) because all the other Porgies were giving him sad eyes was just unnecessary and like the rest of the film left me saying \"wait, wha?\".\n",

      "I woke up this morning to the surprising disbelief of an incredible wave of backlash and overly-sensitive \"bitching\" towards a movie which I saw last night and have since felt incredibly excited and moved by. \n",

      "Whatever the reason may be, the basis of disappointment appears to come from framing tiny elements of expectation that you could hold upon pretty much any motion picture, not just a Star Wars movie, and insulting them to shreds, pointlessly as if judging the sky is blue, but not that Skywalker blue that I jerk off to, no offense. \n",
      "That being said, Force Awakens didn't do many favors to this follow-up installment, giving fans an overload of highly anticipated questions, creating self-fan theories to dwell about for 2 years and for the sensational talent of Rian Johnson to be bound by the difficulty of continuing where J. J. left off. \n",
      "However, what I experienced last night was a spectacularly cinematic follow-up and almost orgasmic orchestration of sci-fi adventure and momentous climaxes, built-up with such filmmaking quality and high-brow entertainment, it had me in applause. \n",
      "Whatever the unjustified consensus of disappointment is, I was surely not apart of that crowd in the experience as I was taken back by the brilliance of where Rian Johnson took this story. \n",
      "If anything, Episode 8 could've been somewhat stretched out in moments, to focus and hone in on the true emotion of the characters fully. \n",
      "But how it plays out naturally is still as epic as any moment in the saga's history, from my viewing opinion. \n",
      "And really if we're going to talk about reliable opinions, it's funny how critics, moviegoers who get paid to watch and review 5 or so movies per week in a professional context, without bias or else they'd be fired, have agreed to a critical acclaim consensus of 86/100 on Metacritic and 93% on Rottentomatoes... compared to that of many whiny fanboys, nitpicking useless and unnecessary details including mythological story-points which give no valid reason of judgement, that most true moviegoers and critics don't even look twice at because they're disregarding the most important element in seeing a movie which is the cinematic experience. This isn't some fan-approved, perfectly designed absolute creation of speculation, this is a movie to be entertained and enjoyed by. It's Star Wars for God sakes. \n",
      "And if you ask any one of these crying fans what they're feeling of cinematic experience was, they completely disregard that being probably the most important aspect in seeing a movie in the first place. \n",
      "Whatever it is we had hoped or expected Last Jedi to be, based upon my vast movie-going experiences over my lifetime, Star Wars The Last Jedi, in terms of cinematic experience, stands as the most entertaining movie of the year, hands down. Maybe I'm the only one, but that's what I saw. \n",
      "Knowing the opinions people have towards other movies this year and the horrid nature they have against this movie makes no sense knowing the quality of those other films compared to this one. Whatever the expectation may be, I know quality when I see it and Episode 8 captures everything I hope for in movies, and I'm looking forward to seeing it again and again over the Christmas holiday season.

      "This is a decent movie. Star Wars fans freak out about everything now and are very hard to please. With this being said it does have some issues. Probably easiest to break it down in pros and cons.Pros:\n",
      "The action/battle scenes were on point. The Kylo/Rey battle when they fight guards gave me chills with excitement. All the other battle scenes were well done as well.The creatures in this movie we're all well done. The crystal foxes, the animals they raced on the casino planet we're cool, porgs we're epic, and all the other creatures on Ahcu-To were all well done. I like that Rey's parents are nobodies. I think fans need to let go sometimes and realize it's a fucking universe of a million planets and the force can be with anyone and not just this specific family lineage. Quit being little Slitherins about it. They did a great job with Yoda. Like it couldn't have gone better and he looked more like he did from Return of the Jedi which made me happy.ConsFirst off I am more of a light side/Jedi fan, but what they did with Snoke was a disappointment. Like this guy lived to be old as fuck and is this powerful with the force and they just kill him off almost instantly and you get nothing about who the hell he is. After the years people have been theory crafting about who he is and you don't find out shit. They overdid it with the hot head crap with Poe. They took a great character and just tore him down and made him look like a tool. I think a little bit of it woulda been great to show he was a hot head and they could out him in his place, but they did it like a crap ton. If you liked Poe in the first movie get over him now cause he's no longer a hero/skilled pilot, just a liability and tool.In fact going on the whole Poe thing further. In general this movie was making a great effort to glorify women the entire time and make fools of men. If I had to think about it they make almost every male character look like a tool at one point or another. Most of this bashing was focused on Poe from a woman admiral that replaces Leia when she gets injured, but Finn had moments of being made to look foolish, and Kylo yet again gets his ass knocked out by Rey and we as fans have no excuse that he got shot with Chewies bowcaster this time. What Disney did with Leia was pretty silly imo. So she gets blown out of the bridge and flies out into space for a good amount of time and she is supposed to be just fine because of the force I guess? They did this with plo koon in the clone wars but easily explained it by him being an alien race that could with stand space for brief moment and Jedi master. This chick gets blown up and sent to space and chills there for awhile and force pulls herself back to the ship.... There is a fine line when they go too far with stuff. They did a great job expanding on abilities with the force like going into people's minds, paralyzing people with the force, Luke's stunt at end, but they may have gone too far with this one.This movie did well at pleasing a broad range of audiences from children to adults. Unfortunately when you spread yourself to such a broad age range die hard fans that want everything a specific way won't be happy. Many people complain about the comical feel of it. I agree there is a lot of comedy brought to this, but I don't think new generations of Star Wars fans (children) wouldn't enjoy it if it was left just dark and so much death. The comedy was well done and wasn't cheesy like it was with Jar Jar. Hopefully they can build on this and end on an epic note with the next one.\n",

      "I thought it was imposable to make a Star Wars film that would be worse than the prequels but yet after the last Jedi I hanker to see them again to wrap myself up in them like a child with a favourite blanket.SPOLIERS AHEADI did write a much longer review but there is so much wrong with this film it went on and on much like TLJ slow-motion space chase.They just threw everything that JJ had set up in TFA, destroyed all the history lore and mystery surrounding the force and characters built up in TFA.As a sci fi film it was visually very good in places but as a Star Wars film it was very very bad.Luke states he went to the island to die, so WTF was the point of leaving a MAP! He is just portrayed as a cowardly old man who's character bears no resemblance to the one we have seen over the last forty years in books, comics or in any of his SW history.Finn and the Plumber (Rose) head off to find someone that is never needed and their whole story arc is just PC bull or filler. You decide!Rey is pretty much a Jedi without needing any training whatsoever who's parents were in fact junkies.Snoke the mysterious dark side user who has been around and watched the empire come and go from afar.

It is interesting the Critics and youtube reviewers jumping through hoops claiming that all the negative ratings are \"Fake news people Fake news\" At the end of the film we end up pretty much where we started except Luke is dead from exhaustion, Leia is alive thanks to a superwoman moment. Rey can seemingly lift half a mountains worth of boulders without any training. Finn is nursing the Plumber (Rose). Admiral Ackbar was dead and had about 30 seconds worth of screen time but no one cared. Who knows what happened to C3PO or R2D2 in the end. At least there will be plenty of food on the falcon. Porg anyone! once they get Chewie cooking, as he did little else in the film apart from playing Uber. As the handful of rebels left all piled onto the Falcon and that's it until 2019.I have no real interest left in any of the characters, I wanted to by the end but feel there was such a lack of character development with most of the interesting characters being killed off. I find I have no real emotional attachment to any of the ones that are left.There were so many more plot holes, questions raised or left unanswered.

      "Rian Johnson finally had the guts to divert from the standard Star Wars formula, something that lacked in The Force Awakens. This is very much Rian Johnson's version of Star Wars, playing with comic relief, being creative with audio to build tension and surprising us with the plot over and over. My viewing party laughed, cried and celebrated.\n",
      "All of this however, needs to be taken with a grain of salt. The movie admittingly had its fair share of excellent moments, however some were amply abysmal.MISSES\n",
      "Firstly, there were plenty of things that grinded my gears; Rebel bombers being useless due to their lack of speed and large size. Fighters being able to blast capital ship turrets without any problems and the Rebel celebration at the end of the movie after being utterly decimated by the First Order.Secondly, I am disappointed by how the movie handles Leia's near-death-experience. I am all for Leia having Force powers, however her flying back to the ship all Mary Poppins style seems over-the-top, especially considering her lack of impact in the rest of the movie. I would have preferred Leia to have piloted the Rebel Capital into the First Order's fleet, instead of Holdo. Finally, some dialogue was downright terrible, on level with the prequels. For instance, that moment when Leia and Holdo said goodbye and they both go \"may the fo-\" and then laugh nervously; I didn't come to watch a teen romcom.PLOT\n",
      "The plot, however, was excellent, finally delving into the relationship between Kylo and Rey. Learning about the turn of Kylo to the Dark Side and Luke's reason for hiding was an interesting revelation. It makes Luke seem less of the hero we thought he was, although he does redeem himself fantastically on Crait at the end of the movie. I would have loved for Snoke to live longer, so we could get to know him and his story better, however Kylo rising to the position of Surpreme Leader is very promising, and Snoke dying was a beautiful twist. On the other hand, the arc between Finn and Rose seemed bland. They search for the 'master codebreaker', however they divert from this quickly and hook up with another dude. The guy Maz sent them after was only given about five seconds of screen-time!A point that I haven't seen made yet is that this film resonates very much with the current political scenario:The Original Trilogy was a cold war film, where huge empires were taken down by ragtag heroic organizations. The Prequel Trilogy was a critique of Bush Era politics (even with a direct quote by Anakin), how war can be a tool in consolidating power, how many of the conflicts are fictitious.The Sequel Trilogy is set in an era where we are becoming seemingly overwhelmed by forces of evil. Intolerance, cyberwarfare, an almost unstoppable surge of populist strongmen... all at the leisure of a super-rich elite. I thought Canto Bight was the most important part of the film. It threw in everybody's face how rich people profit from suffering, how they enslave, humiliate and exclude for their own gain.CONCLUSION\n",
      "In conclusion, the movie excellently builds further on the plot established by The Force Awakens, and it will be interesting how the Rey and Kylo conflict continues. It is, however, plagued by some bad\n",
      "dialogue and mis-timed humour. Luckily the great moments outweigh the terrible; Yoda's appearance, the Rey and Luke plotline and the break in to Snokes ship save the day.VERDICT: 8/10 \n",
      "Plagued by some terrible mistakes, the movie expands the force-users plotlines excellently and manages to entice the audience with an amazing story.\n",

      "Just a mere two years ago, something was awoken in Star Wars fans across the globe. Snoke told us so in the opening line of the first trailer for Episode VII. Was it our hope? Was it our faith? Was it that feeling called optimism; could Star Wars once again return to the glory days of the original trilogy? As the sun sets on 2017, whatever it was, has gone. Disney, Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson unloaded a 12 gauge shotgun and dragged out the cold, lifeless carcass of everything Star Wars represented and sold it for billions of dollars to audiences worldwide. I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened.To be clear, I have no bias against the Disney era of Star Wars. The Force Awakens was a thoroughly watchable journey, based loosely on the plot of A New Hope, which balanced nostalgia with a healthy amount of humour. A plethora of new and energetic characters combined effortlessly with the cast of the original trilogy. Han Solo brought the quality and his eventual death gave us the drama. Only the lack of screen time given to Luke Skywalker and the lazy similarities to Episode IV held back this film.\n",
      "The follow up was 2016's spin-off, Rogue One, a film I simply rank as my third favourite from a galaxy far, far away. \n",
      "By Christmas 2016, Disney had miraculously pulled off the impossible and recovered Star Wars from the politically charged, CGI-mess fests which are known as the prequels.\n",
      "As the credits rolled on Episode VII, JJ Abrams had successfully teased the fans and left us with a delicate cliffhanger with an intriguing finale. As Rey handed Luke his old lightsaber, JJ completed his handover to Rian Johnson.\n",
      "Who is Rey and where does her connection to the force stem? Has Snoke been lurking in the background throughout the saga? Has he always been the ultimate puppet master, manipulating those from the dark side of the force? Why is Luke Skywalker in hiding and how powerful has he become? Ultimately, can good ever truly overcome evil? \n",
      "Since leaving the two apprentices, Rey and Kylo, embarking on their education down the light and dark sides of the force, respectively, we the fans have debated and pondered the aforementioned questions, amongst others, for twenty-four long months. Surely with all of this new energy and the limitless possibilities, a cinematic moment of history similar to that of Darth Vader's fatherly confession to Luke in Episode V would be a certainty.This is not going to go the way you think!Sadly the film which was delivered by Rian Johnson is nothing more than 152 minutes of questionable cheese; a fluff piece so out of sync with the history of Star Wars, that even still after 24 hours of leaving the screening, I am left with a bitter taste in my mouth. Suddenly the problems which plagued the prequels; Jar Jar Binks and Anakin's issues with sand seem like a distant memory. Nothing more than a blip on George Lucas' now bulletproofed reputation.\n",
      "Was this really a Star Wars film I endured? I remain confused how a Star Wars film could conclude without the sound of a single lightsaber clash against another? Maybe I missed this moment while my head buried in my hands, as one embarrassing joke or scene played out after another.\n",
      "The awkward and often forced humour which cluttered the script was topped off by a humiliating scene of near-death experience, as a decomposing Princess Leia drifted lifeless through space. \n",
      "Instead of allowing the now-deceased Carrie Fisher the opportunity to depart the saga gracefully, the director chose for her character to learn the power of flight, so she could glide through space wreckage onto the landing bay of a cruiser. Thanks to this ridiculous idea, we can all look forward to CGI Princess Leia making a return for the next instalment. This was just one catastrophic error in a movie strewn with many more.\n",
      "Finn's side plot to find an infamous code-breaker on a planetary sized Monte Carlo; and then ultimately back onto the First Order's dreadnought which had all the while been engaged in the slowest and least inspiring chase of a Resistance cruiser, which was oddly under threat from an ill-conceived Poe Dameron led mutiny, wound up being entirely fruitless and an utter waste of time. Not even the acting talents of Benicio del Toro who had been picked up along the way, could salvage any reason for his character's existence. However thanks to the visit to this new gambling-mad planet, Cantonica, the audience were treated to at least one writers strangely placed and not-so-subtle opinions on wealth inequality, arms dealing and animal rights. The lessons on morality did feel a little hypocritical coming from a film being produced by one of the world's wealthiest conglomerates.\n",
      "As for the journeys of our main protagonists and antagonists, their education in the force and the questions we had been left with since 2015; be prepared for disappointment.Let the past die. Kill it, if you have to. That's the only way to become what you are meant to be.The only logical explanation I can summon is that Rian Johnson had never watched a single Star Wars Episode, or he simply despised the saga and has now staged a master plan for its demise. The other possibility is that JJ Abrams forgot to pass the memo which would detail his ideas to follow on from The Force Awakens.\n",
      "Throughout all of the confusion and clutter which is The Last Jedi, you will not find any fluid or sensible attempt to explain the ultimate vision which had been born from Episode VII.\n",
      "Snoke, the all-powerful Supreme Leader who's potential links to the Sith Lord, Darth Plagueis which had created a buzz of excitement following TFA, was the first character to fall victim of a lazy and botched screenplay, as he found himself decapitated by his own apprentice after no more than 20 minutes of screen time. Captain Phasma faired no better as she too met her demise after less than 5 minutes of screen time. Once again the valuable lessons from past mistakes had been ignored. Before the fans had enjoyed an opportunity to learn about the history and background of these latest on-screen villains, they had met their untimely deaths, mirroring the similar feat of both Darth Maul and Boba Fett.\n",
      "As for the background of Rey and the question mark over her lineage, we the audience were offered the game-changing revelation that her parents were nothing more than 'filthy junk traders' who had sold her for booze. No connection to the Skywalker, Kenobi or Palpatine bloodline after all and thus another missed opportunity to create some form of depth to a story fast losing all purpose and reason to continue.\n",
      "The greatest insult of all was saved for the treatment of Luke Skywalker himself. The hero of the original trilogy, the Jedi who sought after the good in his father where others saw only evil. The character who inspired moviegoers across the world was now reduced to nothing more than a coward; a hermit who briefly considered murdering his own nephew in his sleep. Mark Hamill had told director Rian Johnson, \"I pretty much fundamentally disagree with every choice you've made for this character (Luke Skywalker).\" \n",
      "I can understand why. \n",
      "The hero who had once taken on the Emperor now chose to hide away on his private island, allowing others to fight and die on his behalf. Before the credits rolled on this shit-shower of a film, the legendary character of Luke Skywalker was killed off in the least poetic and unexplainable way possible, adding zero contribution to the future of the saga. With only the two apprentices, Rey and Kylo, remaining for the final act, still having received little training from their now deceased mentors, it is difficult to understand where the direction of Star Wars is leading. Never mind the strange decision to retain the only character left from The Return of the Jedi, Princess Leia, soon to be portrayed in CGI. \n"

      "As Kylo Ren states in the film, \"let the past die\". Maybe Rian Johnson felt this idea was a necessity in order to create his own vision of where Star Wars should go?Maybe one day we will call these choices brave? For now, I call them an insult. Let the past die but not in this manner. Overall The Last Jedi is a poorly written and poorly planned excuse of a film which is nothing better than a disgrace to the legacy of those films which had come before. Where the saga can go now, I simply do not know, but at least we can always rely on John Williams to provide a terrific soundtrack.\n",

      "My pismire opinion clearly does not matter in this world, given these \"capeshit\" et al. turds rake in Shoah numbers at the box office, for each and every cookie cutter copy-pasta entrant. As such, I'll simply run through a synopsis of Shekel Whores: The Loser Jedi; for those who want a run-down before they wast-- INVEST 2.5 hours of their lives (+ change) in this latest flagellation by, what Jabba the Lucas called (IIRC), its \"kike slavers\" (affectionately, \"Disney\").We pick up during a space chase scene, where the Faecal Odour is perusing the Resistance to Logic--who are themselves fast running out of some undefined \"fuel\"; whereafter they will be captured and / or destroyed. Here we're treated to some protracted tit-for-tat laser cannon exchanges, ship incursions, Poo Digimon's 9-11 level piloting prowess, impossibly unlikely Sino-assissted 'David' victory of 'Goliath' (U.S.?) scenes... explosion-proof space Leia conducting EVA's (extra-vehicular activities).From the mayhem of space, we're whisked off to Vagrant Isle, where our muc-- ONCE-loved Star Wars protagonist, Luke Slumlurcher now resides as a defeated hobo who, every day, holds his breath and prays for death... after indulging his bestial lactation fetishism, that is! Here, the film's \"training sequence\" takes place, wherein Mary Sue is \"trained\" in the arcane Jed-- SHEDI arts; and although her \"training\" consists of little more than a single, comedic 'Daniel-san' skit involving a rock and some fortuitous indigenous Amish creatures, the audience by now fully understands the goddess mode that Mary Sue is erupting from every cleansed pour with -- thus, rendering any actual training utterly pointless (indeed, potentially insulting / man-splaningly misogynistic). Suffice it to say, the trolly ghost, Yoda now appears and summons the god of lightening (i.e., electrical voltage / current -- compare: thunder / sound) to destroy the Jedi wishing tree. For Shedi care not for whimpy man-canon or lore... or their cooties!Once the now Master Shedi, Mary Sue (pbuh) beats the hermit vagrant, Slumlurcher down to the ground with a stick (as all men deserve to be treated... unless they're of discernible African or Arabic descent... in which case, they should be mated with immediately), we move from Degobah 2.0 back to the theater of space. Cue: our resident Gomer Pyle, Mopboy, who has since awoken after convalescence from spinal cauterisation (courtesy of a near-victory against cheating bad boy gone emo, Gaylord Rim -- Schlock Worse: The Faeces Evacuates); and after meeting the mail order love of his life (Mai Mong Fat), they embark on a carefully-constructed expedition to recover Benicio Del Toro with his Rubik's cube solving skills--required in order to decrypt some highly esoteric, fangled Faecal Odour whatsit thingie. ...Oh! And did I mention Mopboy was--himself--privy to the inner workings of the mechanised monolith menacing our triple-zero heroes...? Who's a clever Mopboy, then? Bumbling Jar Jar: eat your ass out! =D Thus, our newly-formed dynamic duo (+soccerbot) then embark on their adjunct adventure...Meanwhile, Mary Sue - after having ESP-dated Gaylord back on Indigents' Isle, using the Farce, across the fabric of space-time (...only to be rudely interrupted by that loathsome lecher, Slumlurcher; just as Gaylord was getting naked and a cherry-popping looked in order) - has now decided she can turn her sulking suitor away from his masculine path, back towards the light of tomboy-ish femininity (...after all, we all start life as XX chromosomes!). In turn, together they confront Supreme SmÃ©agol Joke -- vanquishing this forever-anonymous foe back to Middle-earth; thereafter disposing of his electric boogaloo baton wielding, somewhat cross-eyed, dancing dervishes of devilry. Now, Mary Sue must decide whether to accompany Gaylord towards raging petulance, or to go at it alone...By this time, not only have Mopboy and Mai Mong Fat returned to the Resistance of Logic's main fleet - having completed their largely CGI-based McGuff-- MEANINGFUL MISSION in Macau - but the crescendo of this grand Johnson throbbing opus, is fast-approaching its regrettable conclusion (...two-and-a-half hours sure do fly when one's in the throes of nauseous delirium!). Hence, the Faecal Odour have all but ensnared their prey and everything looks lost... BUT for the Admiral Ackbar stand-in she-general, who - after having an Digimon ad hoc coup (grrr... men!) foiled by a comatose space Leia's \"Wrath of God\" magic attack (*req. 40 FAITH) - off-the-cuff MacGyvers a light speed missile from her mother ship, destroying the entire Faecal armada, with one, righteous display of martyrdom! (EAT THAT!! SHARI-- GURL POWER, FTW!).Now we can get down to the nub of the film: the Luke-Gaylord showdown on Hoth 2.0.... and what a showdown it is! However, I will not spoil it here for readers, as this is surely one of the most viscerally heart-wrenching destructions in the history of cinematic defilement of seminal, much-loved characters. And if that reads overly bombastic, I will simply point the good reader to the post-premier video interview with Rian Johnson and Mark Hamill, and entreat them to keep their eyes affixed on the latter actor of the franchise's stalwart protagonist. What is witnessed here, cannot be unseen and will elucidate all that is nebulous in the minds of those who are ambivalent regarding where this franchise is headed / been flushed.Summation:\n",

      "Directed by Rian Johnson (who directed 2012's novel and sometimes brutal Sci-Fi epic \"Looper\"), \"The Last Jedi\" picks up just before where \"The Force Awakens\" finishes with a dramatic and action-packed recreation of a WW2 bombing mission, featuring Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac, \"Ex Machina\", \"Inside Llewyn Davis\") in fighter-pilot mode. With perhaps the exception of \"Rogue One\"'s finale, never has the heroism and loss of the plucky rebel band been better portrayed.We then flip to that rocky (definitely not Irish!) island to see what happens when Rey (Daisy Ridley) gives the light sabre to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). The answer may surprise you. Rey, haunted by her quest to understand her powers and her parental lineage, is there to persuade the hermit-like Skywalker to reclaim his hero-status and return to fight for the rebellion. But that help had better come soon, since the evil supreme leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and his henchman Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) are tracking and pursuing a rapidly dwindling number of rebel fighters, led by Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), in what could be the rebellion's last stand. First and foremost, there's a lot of good things to like in this film. For a genre that's often eschewed strong female roles, here is a film where women use light sabres to smash through the Sci-Fi glass ceiling. Rey is an enormously strong role-model for young girls: intelligent, plucky and resourceful as well as being athletic, emotional and gorgeous. In the words of Whitney Houston, she IS every woman. But the XX chromosomes don't stop there, with a new heroine in the form of the low-tech Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) breathing some fresh air into the younger-hero dynamic with Finn (John Boyega). And notably, the key leaders of the rebel alliance - Leia and newcomer Vice Admimal Holdo (Jurassic Park's Laura Dern) are, as older women, both strong and unquestioned leaders of men. All the acting is above par, with Hamill in particular having enormous fun with his role and Serkis as Snoke oozing evil even through his Mo-Cap CGI. There are some very funny one-liners and sight gags that enliven the action significantly without (I felt) ever going over the top into \"Kingsman\" territory: a brush of dirt off the shoulder by Hamill is a high-point to watch out for. Benicio del Toro (\"Sicario\") is also great value as a mercenary \"darker Han Solo\" character. And acting is required, for there is some significant dramatic content delivered through the story. The conflict and animosity between the connected Rey and Ren - a sort of telepathic Facetime - has to be worked through and, with Carrie Fisher's untimely death, you could probably predict that there will be at least one high-profile exit from this episode.Technically, the film excels. John Williams again delivers a rousing score, and at times has so many themes to play with from the eight main films that he hardly knows what to do with them all in the bars available! The film also delivers (from special effects coordinators Chris Corbould and Branko Repalust) some eye-widening CGI, especially for scenes set on \"bloody salt flats\" (there's no other way to describe them) being particularly impressive. There are moments of sheer cinematic joy, with a dramatic and devestating jump to light speed being visually and aurally one of the most gasp-inducing bits of cinema I will see this year.Rather disappointingly though there seems to be little novelty shown in the edited department. Star Wars was always known for its clever scene transitions, but here we jump from location to location in a notably choppy and clunky manner. Where the wheels come off though is with the story, also by Rian Johnson. More on this is in a spoiler section on my review site (since it's difficult to make spoiler-free comments), but enough to say at this point that the film is (unnecessarily) over-long, has a very inconsistent pace, and (with retrospect) some key aspects of the story just don't logically stand up to scrutiny. So, did I enjoy this film? Yes I did. But did it fully meet my (high) expectations? No it didn't. And curiously, the more I have dwelt on the plot, the less satisfied I have become with it. Whereas I left the theatre with an 8* rating in mind, with reflection this has dropped (and might drop further)(For the full graphical review - including a spoiler section discussion - please visit bob-the-moie-man.com)..\n",

      "Well it's finally here! The epic movie that television has bombarded us with for the last three months has finally appeared from light speed to grace us with another epic installment, or so we hope. Episode 8 has held the promise of the return of story telling, matching the epic lore of the originals told to hopefully breathe life in a series that has struggled. Rumors even say it surpasses Empire Strikes Back, the movie that holds the throne of Star Wars quality. Can this be true? Has the Force grown strong once more? Robbie K here to shed light on the rumors and hopefully provide some wisdom. Get Started, Let's!LIKES:The Cinematography: My wise friends stated right off that this movie may be the best filmed of the bunch. The Last Jedi is a beautiful example of camera work meeting state of the art technology, helping bring the world to life with spectacular visuals. The various angles keep you engrossed in all the details, and paints a very dynamic battleground to which our cast fights in. And unlike episode 7, the sound score is back to Williams' creative work, a blend of old and new that fits into the scene and adds the life to an already vibrant setting. The Acting: A large cast of characters, requires acting to bring them to life, and the Last Jedi has recruited a phenomenal crew to accomplish this goal. I can't go into great details, but here we go. Mark Hamill brings the fire back into Luke Skywalker with both classic and old Luke style clashing into a complex character. Daisy Ridley takes the simplistic Rey from last time and unleashes her character in full \"force\" expanding her into a fantastic character that is full of spunk. Carrie Fisher another victory when on screen, that has the vim and vigor of the wizened princess we loved. Newcomers Laura Dern and Kelly Marie Tran were welcomed additions to the cast. Dern's chameleon like abilities continue to craft respectable and honorable characters that fit well in Leia's legacy, with a nice edge to keep things tense. Tran on the other hand is the hopeful character, that has nice delivery of inspirational dialogue, with a dab of rebellion on the side. Everyone worked quite well and I wish I had more time to compliment everyone, but trust me it's good. The Comedy: A nice quality to have, the comedy in this movie is a nice relief to the darker atmosphere on this side of the galaxy. The Last Jedi's writing is a combination of good timing and wit, that beats in time with all the characters. The ever changing ploys also keeps things fun to watch and had my mentor and I guffawing through much of the movie. The Storytelling: Perhaps the strongest aspect of the Last Jedi is the presentation in terms of plot in this movie. Director Rian Johnson dug deep into the lore and ignited it in full form in installment eight, bringing with it rich details that answered much of our questions. Much of the tale is character development, pushing them hard to expand upon their hastened roles of seven into more complete soldiers to partake this journey with. The three tales were balanced quite well, spaced out to keep things relevant and each connecting to the big plot as a whole, much like the classic tales were in. These tales are not only adventurous, but filled with strong lessons that this series is famous for preaching. And yet the biggest part of this I like are the twists integrated in this film. Many surprises lie in store for this movie, and many of them fit nicely to take the story deeper down the dark hole. These surprises are perhaps the most engaging parts of the movie, the likes of which weren't expected much like Empire. DISLIKES:Salvaged Plots: Despite the strengths I have mentioned in the plot, this modern trilogy still has issues with being too close to the classic series. A blend of episodes five and six, much of this film is a retelling of those classic arcs that is a little disappointing on their dependence to the old and not trying out new elements. At least it is executed, well right?Unnecessary Tangent: One of the story points almost didn't feel needed, or at least one section of the tangent wasn't that big of a hit for me. The world of Canto Bight makes statements, has a connecting point, and a memorable scene, but this small adventure felt out of place in the grand design. It will bring merchandise opportunities, one of which is a book, but this world didn't hold much value to me outside of a few laughs and some cool beasts. Perhaps a little more struggle, or intensity could have redeemed it for me, though it still isn't too bad for me. Suspension of reality: I get it, it's Star Wars and that is Sci-Fi/Fantasy. Still, there has to be some consistency in regards to how you are going to ignore the physics of real life and the lore that came before. There are moments you will roll your eyes at in terms of the inabilities of the technology, or how uneven the skills seem to develop. While we could ignore these if they were minor, the movie's key situation relied on this suspension and it was a little too big of a stretch for me. The Action: Star Wars is a series that relies on action to pick things up and make add the fire that makes the story shine like the stars. With a rather intense start, Last Jedi had potential, but soon that potential was lost to the void. Much of this movie is dialogue, development, and connections, and with it one of the slower paces of the series. Yes, there were a few moments to help pick up the pace, but much of this was short lives or lacking that laser packing punch I loved in the first installments. Say what you want about the prequels, but they had some incredible fight scenes that livened things up and the Last Jedi really needed this element for me. The VERDICT: The Last Jedi is indeed proof that the universe still has life left in the void of the galaxy Lucas created. It's got emotion! It's got character development! It's got twists! All of this is important in developing characters and making them fly off the screen. Throw in great acting and beautiful cinematography and you have a really, well done film. Yet, this generation still is not escaping the salvaging of the classic plot points, while their unique aspects need a little tweaking in terms of relevance. However, the biggest improvement has got to be the action, working to bring the ship to ship combat back to full strength, and really getting those lightsaber battles back up to snuff. Still, it's a fantastic film to catch in theaters and definitely a worthy installment to Lucas's world. My scores: \n",
      "Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0\n",
      "Movie Overall: 8.0\n",

      "This review was motivated by the sharp divide between critics and moviegoers. After viewing The Last Jedi, I also feel that the film suffers from a number of flaws that professional critics have surprisingly dismissed.The main issues I have with this film are the following: 1. Lowbrow humourPut bluntly, the humour ruins The Last Jedi. Comedy is not such an easy aspect of film-making, especially when incorporated into an action film. Too many jokes make the story feel superficial, and inconsequential. As is the case in The Last Jedi.Some filmmakers handle comedy well (Steven Spielberg), some master the art of wit so well that the humour feels smart and seamless (Joss Whedon), some elevate it to the rank of art (Edgar Wrigth) or transform it into a crossbred genre of its own (Matthew Vaughn). On the other hand, in The Last Jedi, the jokes feel childish (ranging from a mamma joke, to the portrayal of Luke milking a creature with an unsubtle and puerile visual symbolism). They are also too frequent. The entire first act is reduced to a series of lowbrow gags that lowers the stakes. This makes the supposedly serious events that follow much less enthralling. I don't want to be mean toward Rian Johnson. I understand the risk he took by making something different. But I don't think it helps anyone when critics praise poorly written comedy. At best, we could say that Johnson has a particular style of humour, one that may not suit everyone. Or it could be some studio directive; many have pointed out to the resemblance between Last Jedi and recent Marvel films (Disney owns Marvel Studios). Yet, regardless of the target audience, low quality humour is always worse than a carefully crafted script. 2. The social commentary feels insincereIn a sense, I would have liked to praise the director/writer for evoking economic inequalities - a (tedious) story arc follows Finn and a new character on a casino planet, with obvious references to the exploitation of camel jockeys in the real world. However, when the message comes from a billion dollar franchise that aggressively markets its products to children, this just feels out of place. If not, completely out of touch. Moreover, it's hard not to assume that the character stressing these economic ideas, Rose, was included in the film to appeal to foreign markets and boost profits, which makes the whole commentary sound even more hypocrite (whether it was the intention or not). One can make a similar comment about a male director/writer offering views on the place of women in the ranks of the rebellion. It does not ring true in The Last Jedi. (To reassure those who claim the film may have \"feminist\" undertones: on the contrary, the treatment of gender issues is heavy-handed and unconvincing. There is nothing to \"worry\" about because nothing meaningful or relevant is brought to the script.)To some extent, I did enjoy the ambiguity with which Johnson portrayed the relationship within the chain of command (the Poe Dameron/Vice-Admiral Holdo struggle). I don't view it as a gender issue at all, but as an opportunity to study the relations of power in the workplace, like Star Trek did so well (see TNG's brilliant Chain of Commands or Lower Decks episodes, for instance). Ultimately, however, this idea does not lead to such a satisfactory conclusion in The Last Jedi. Like many other aspects of the script, it is not fully fleshed out. Some casual viewers may ignore the irony of having a billion dollar media empire producing a film that complains about inequality, and it's fine. However, I think many will feel that something does not sound true in the story. 3. The fight against the First Order feels vapidPerhaps because of the poor comedy and the phony aspects of the script, it's very hard to feel anything about the fight between rebels (or the Republic) and the First Order. You can only stretch the same idea so many times. Rian Johnson decided to tear apart the Jedi mythology, but as a result the background fight that remains, which we are supposed to care about, feels extremely shallow. The film would be improved by giving the viewers a sense of what is at stake. There is no need for plain exposition to achieve this. But understanding what the First Order is after, what remains of the Republic, is the bare minimum needed for viewers to give a damn about what is going on. Nothing is offered in that regard. Consequently, the battles feel shallow, reduced to a spectacle of special effects with characters having little that is genuinely relatable. I've rarely felt less engaged by a Star Wars movie in the past. It seems that Johnson had an idea in mind that could have been interesting. That the divide between good and evil, the First Order and the rebels, was not as obvious as it seems (as illustrated by the revelations from the codebreaker). But this idea is never fleshed out either; in the end, it is pointless for the conclusion of the film, which returns to a typical battle between the good guys and the bad guys. 4. The treatment of LukeI won't dwell on this, because fans have discussed the issue a lot (not to mention, Mark Hamill himself). Luke Skywalker is out of character in this film. The background story of him and Kylo Ren is tonally inconsistent with what we know of the character, and the rest of the franchise. This makes it difficult for a viewer to maintain any suspension of disbelief. Especially since there were hundreds of possibilities to write a compelling story about him.The positivesI'm seriously struggling to find positive elements for this film. It boils down to two things: the score, and the visual effects. But a film cannot be reduced to that.There is a nice final battle between Luke and Ren, sure. I also liked the development of the relationship between Kylo Ren and Rey. But the latter does not lead to any \"big moment\" or emotional payoff that would make this development worthwhile. VerdictOverall, the negatives outweigh the positives for this film. The Last Jedi is tonally all over the place. The comedy is not well integrated. And major issues undermine the plot. Some interesting ideas are planted here and there, but never developed to satisfaction. The film is so uneven that it's hard to compare it to other entries in the franchise. In a sense, the Last Jedi feels like a large budget school movie with an unpolished script. J.J. Abrams' The Force Awakens shines in comparison. Because it throws the mythos out of the window without replacing it with anything substantial to feed on, I can understand why so many Star Wars fans hated The Last Jedi.\n",

      "NO SPOILERS:I am not a Star Wars fan boy. In fact, my introduction to the franchise was with the prequels. Being of a younger generation, the magic of the original trilogy is lost on me. I can absolutely respect the phenomenon the original trilogy was at the time of their release, and the impact they have had on the movie industry.Enter 2015's The Force Awakens: J. J. Abrams, riding off the success of similar sci-fi adventure films- Star Trek and Star Trek: Into Darkness, is set to direct the reboot of the Star Wars franchise with a sequel to the original trilogy. With J.J. Abrams directing, I had faith that TFA would be at least, an enjoyable adventure film. To my delight, TFA was a successful reboot of the Star Wars franchise, introducing a cast of new, dynamic, interesting characters in addition to the older, supporting, less interesting ones. Despite the latter half of TFA following way to close to the plot of A New Hope, TFA overall was a great film introducing many new exciting characters and elements to the Star Wars universe. In addition to many other problems, perhaps The Last Jedi's most monumental flaw is its disregard for its predecessor. Many plot elements foreshadowed or alluded to in TFA are stamped viciously out of the plot in TLJ- and what is left over is too contrived and thematically confused to stand alone.SPOILERS:For the past two years, fans of Star Wars have been speculating on the origins and identify of Snoke, the identity of Rey's parents, the reason for Luke's isolation, who the Knights of Ren are, and a whole slew of other theories. All of these interesting plot elements introduced in The Force Awakens are eviscerated in The Last Jedi. Personally, I am incredibly bothered by ignorance to continuity in film. As many other critics and fans online have said, Rian Johnson throws away the vision of JJ Abrams' new Star Wars trilogy as unceremoniously as Luke Skywalker comically tosses his father's light saber over his shoulder off a cliff. Not all of these elements need to be explained, or tie into the plot and history of Star Wars. Rey does not need to be a Skywalker or a Kenobi, and her parents having no significance is actually subversive of a common film trope that all main characters in a film's universe must be related or have strong connections.However, completely ignoring all the foreshadowing and elements introduced in the film immediately before this one is just poor film making. It creates zero payoff for viewers that have paid attention to these questions. And while this problem very well could be attributed the change in directors, it is still not an excuse. Ignoring the ignorance to The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi still has many flaws, but also some strengths.If I could attach a theme to this film, it would be one stated by Yoda: \"failure is the best teacher.\" This is something I actually really liked in the film. The plans and actions carried out by each of the main characters in this film are very, very poorly thought out. And this is fine, if you address in the film that they are indeed poor plans. In fact, it is subversive of film tropes and refreshing to see in mainstream movies. While not completely embracing the flaws of its characters' actions, this film does let its main characters make mistakes, and acknowledges it. Poe's mutiny, Finn and Rose's trusting of a shady character, and Rey's confidence in turning Kylo Ren, all end in failure. Unfortunately, only one of these character's actually learn a lesson from their mistakes as Yoda mentions: Poe. Poe learns that being a hot-headed action hero is not always the answer to the problems set before him, and ultimately learns to be more level-headed, much to the pleasure of his in-film mentor, Leia Organa.Poe's arc in this film is undoubtedly the best part. He tries something, he fails, he learns, he grows. Can that at all be said for the other characters? Perhaps, but are the lessons they learn even worth learning? Finn learns about classism(?) and what the rebellion means to people across the galaxy. Rey- the film's main character- learns aboInut moral ambiguity(?) and the line between good and evil. But do their lessons affect their actions, or cause a change in their character? No, at least not in this film.Ignoring continuity flaws, The Last Jedi's largest hindrance is pacing, and how the entire middle act of the film is based on absolutely contrived plot developments. This film starts off with a space battle. It ends after about 10 minutes with a victory for the resistance but at the cost of many lives and battleships. The very next scene... is another space battle. There are cutaways to scenes of Rey and Luke, but it was a very poor choice to have two of the exact same type of scene right after another in the main plotline. This second space battle occur because the resistance discovers that the First Order can track them through light speed. General Leia is bait-and-switched killed (ugh) and then rendered unconscious. The main characters then rationalize that they can escape if they can destroy the tracker on the first order ship. To do this, they need a master code breaker.At this point in the film, the pacing takes a dramatic and confusing turn. While most of the main cast is being chased and attacked by the First Order, Finn and new character Rose go off on a side plot on a casino planet to find the code breaker, so the other characters can escape. It feels very awkward to have part of the cast fly off to do an entire side plot in the time that the rest of the cast is being chased an exterminated. Meanwhile, back in the \"chase\" plot, it is revealed that Leia's 2nd in command has no plan to escape. Poe, in his hot-headed, take-action style, commits mutiny and takes over the ship to buy time for Finn to get back and destroy the tracker. About an hour later, it is revealed that Finn's side plot to get the code breaker, and Poe's mutiny were both pointless since Leia's 2nd in command actually did have a plan the whole time- but for some reason neglected to tell any of the main characters about it. This reveal, while redeeming Laura Dern's character, renders about an hour of the movie pointless. Why didn't Laura Dern's character tell Poe about her plan? Because if she did then Finn wouldn't have gone to the Casino plan to learn about what the resistance means to normal people! It is an incredibly contrived hour of filmmaking, and very annoying to any viewer that can pay attention.All in all, the The Last Jedi is an enjoyable space adventure film that expands the story of the Star Wars Franchise with new and old faces. However, the story and themes fall flat as it abondons what was setup in its predecessor.\n",

That movie took the safe route and looked a lot like \"A New Hope\" building up the beginning for the next Star Wars trilogy on tested ground.Instead of recycling the original trilogy again I wanted to see a new Star Wars movie, something different and innovative while still keeping the core elements the Star Wars franchise is all about. For the most part I got exactly that and walked out of the premiere with quite positive feelings. I do mostly like this movie but it has some glaring weak points which i have to address. I will try to be as critical and honest as possible.\"The Last Jedi\" is a new, refreshing story which seems at parts a little dragged out with its rather long runtime of 2h 32min but it never gets boring, far from that. Generally speaking the movie has a solid main plot. It is a visually stunning experience with great action sequences. However on the other side it has some plot issues, unanswered questions left from The Force Awakens and weaker subplots which could easily be taken out without harming the main storyline. The movie has a lot of humour, jokes and one-liners in it. Sometimes they are great and offer a good laugh but on the other hand can also feel forced and unnecessary during serious moments of the movie.The story you are going to see is vastly different than anything seen before in Star Wars. Rian Johnson takes us on a new adventure and redefines aspects of the franchise to a large extend but keeps the core intact. It feels like watching a Star Wars movie but it also brings big amounts of innovation which is not to everyone's liking.

Sure, the original films were fun, nothing wrong with that. But they were all, you know, kind of goofy, over-the-top, and unbalanced. This, however, is the opposite of that. This movie makes the original trilogy look like cheap school play. But again, I'm not saying that the original films are bad. They're just pale in comparison to this new one. Rian Johnson is a master of his craft. He's a true genius that deserves all the praise he gets. A true mastermind. A true filmmaker who understands what people want. He made the best movie of the past decade. And we, true Star Wars fans, should be thankful him for that. The characters in here are the best in the series. Snoke and Luke are, unarguably, the most interesting, multi-layered characters in the Star Wars universe. Heck, I can say that they are one of the most interesting characters, period.

      "To clarify before beginning my review, I'm a 34-year-old lifelong female fan (not a misogynistic racist fanboy as some people assume of those who are unimpressed with this movie's outcome). The characterization of Luke and some of the others was downright WRONG, especially to those of us who loved the OT. And let's be clear, I'm not an OT purist. I will defend Revenge of the Sith to my death. I watched the Force Awakens 5 times in theaters. I thought Rogue One was one of the best Star Wars movies ever. But The Last Jedi? This movie broke me. Almost within the first five minutes, I knew this was not going to go well. Other reviewers are probably nailing all the fine details but for me, from the beginning, the writing was uninspired, shaky, and poor. The forced comedy and cheap one-liners all in place it simply DID not belong. Cutaways to the porgs, which I thought I would love and ended up being there purely for kids and merchandising options. Come on, Luke dusting off his shoulder? Throwing the saber over the cliff? And Hux, a character who was set up to be hard and terrifying, was made into a Three Stooges style punchline character almost. Poe was one-dimensional. Holdo was completely unnecessary and looked more like a citizen of the Hunger Games Capital than a character in SW. Finn and Rose's storyline could have been completely taken out. Boring, uninspired, and useless.Kylo and Rey's storyline and their force bond was the only thing that interested me as I hung in there, waiting for some redeemable moment of the movie. I genuinely felt sure that Ben Solo would be redeemed. That is really the way it should have gone. But NOPE. Rian Johnson and company seemed way more determined to write a bunch of trash and twists just to be able to go \"GOTCHA\" to the audience. Well I don't like cheap tricks. There's a difference between good plot twists and bad ones. These were ALL bad, including Leia's sudden space walk many are compared to a Poppins like moment. The characterization and ending of Luke's life and some of the others was downright WRONG, especially to those of us who loved the OT.This is the first Star Wars movie to ever have left me feeling so numb. By the end of the night, hours after we left the theater, I felt totally gutted and crestfallen to realize what the Star Wars sequels had become, because Rian Johnson had to \"Age of Ultron\" the series. Again, Kylo and Rey's storyline was the only thing of interest in this movie, and Rian even messed that up by the end. No chance of redemption now.Well, no thanks to episode 9. I'm done seeing the franchise i love being butchered by Disney and their ever-growing greed taking over with no respect to the characters we love. This was the biggest disappointment of my life.\n",

      "Overall I am giving Star Wars: The Last Jedi 5/10 because I found it to be very disappointing as a sequel to The Force Awakens and it did not feel like a Star Wars film at all. However there were some very good action sequences, especially the one and only lightsaber battle, and the visual effects were stunning.First things first, I am a huge Star Wars fan and I love the vast depth of the Star Wars universe. To sum up my opinions of the previous Star Wars films, I loved the originals, I liked the prequels, I really liked The Force Awakens and I loved Rogue One. I don't often review film and TV but I am very passionate about the film and TV I love.**Spoilers from now on**The Good:As I have already mentioned, the action sequences were very good the entire film had amazing visual effects. I especially liked the Rey and Kylo vs Snoke's guards sequence. I also loved the scene where Vice Admiral Holdo (the woman with purple hair) piloted her ship into Snoke's battleship at lightspeed, the visual effects and sound effects were stunning. The acting was of course great by all the cast, of course. I thought Kylo Ren's plot arc and character was really interesting, as well as his relationship with Rey, and he is my favourite character of those surviving at the end of the film.The Bad:My biggest disappointment was TLJ as a sequel to TFA. JJ Abrams made a good film, TFA, with several mysteries and questions that viewers wanted to know the answers to at the end. One of these mysteries is Snoke's identity. Who is he? Where did he come from? Where was he during the previous films? These mysteries engaged the audience in TFA. But Rian Johnson decided to kill Snoke before these mysteries were answered, and even if we do find out these answers, who cares? He's dead now. I also felt like his death was a bit silly, since he is such a powerful force user, yet he didn't sense Kylo's deception, however this isn't a huge concern of mine. Another of the mysteries JJ Abrams left us with after TFA was Rey's heritage. In this film, Kylo Ren revealed that she is nobody, and that her parents were just some junk traders (or something). She is such a powerful force user that she must have some Jedi (or Sith) heritage. However some may argue that Kylo Ren is lying, but what would be the point in that, from a writer's perspective? This has left me feeling unsatisfied and a viewer shouldn't feel that after watching a film.The humour. I am not an unfunny twat, I enjoy comedies, but Star Wars isn't a comedy. Every other scene had a joke. Some of them were funny, but with all these jokes, as opposed to the occasional jokes in the other films, I just can't take the story in this film seriously. It's a complete joke. The film didn't feel like a Star Wars film at all. What's ironic is that the two directors for the Han Solo spinoff coming out next year were fired by LucasFilm for making it too comedic. What the hell is going on??The plot was a bit sh*t really. Luke learned nothing interesting on the island where the Jedi Order was founded. There was so much potential for some interesting plot developments to do with the force and Rey. Luke also was going to kill Kylo Ren in cold blood which is something the Luke from the originals 100% wouldn't do. The general plot for Leia and company was simply them being chased by the First Order through space and them escaping. The entire plot with Finn and Rose was unnecessary and lead to nothing at all. And then at the end Luke went into god mode and managed to achieve nothing from it except dying. Luke's death should have been more meaningful. Rose saved Finn for love, which was actually really stupid considering Finn was giving up his life to save everyone else. The vast majority of critics and media seem to be giving this film really good reviews, which I cannot comprehend. Yes, you are entitled to an opinion, but these people critique films for a living and yet cannot see the obvious flaws with this film. There are a few more things I could comment on, such as the capabilities of the force ie Luke being able to be a force hologram of himself (but who am I to say what the force can and can't do) and the casino sequence, but I have expressed my key points of disappointment. I hope Rian Johnson acknowledges the film's criticism and learns from it when he creates his upcoming Star Wars trilogy.\n",

      "Let me start off by saying that I am one of the countless people for whom Star Wars was their childhood. ESB wins by a landslide as my favorite movie ever. After the most recent reboot, this movie was truly going to be make or break for me. If it took a page from TFA and just gave us a slightly more modern telling of ESB I would have lost faith in the franchise. I would have lost faith that they actually care about the fan base and want to make movies for us and not just to line their pockets. However, this movie truly struck a chord. Was it a perfect movie? Of course not. Did it do something incredibly brave and original that not only hasn't been done in Star Wars, but in cinema in general? Absolutely. This movie has everything, the epic space battles, incredibly choreographed fighting, quotable lines, and scenes that make you want to stand and cheer. Even if you aren't a Star Wars fan this movie will have something that appeals to you. And if you are a Star Wars fan then I think you're in for quite a treat. Now, to address the people giving this 1/10 for some inane reason. I keep hearing things like \"This was out of character for Luke\" and \"It didn't feel like a Star Wars movie.\" To address the first complaint, all I have to say is, it's called character development, look it up. To address the latter, I say be more open-minded. No this isn't a movie that fits perfectly into the confines of what the previous films have created. But that's a good thing. What Star Wars is at its core, is a risky movie that challenges the norms. 30 years ago when ANH came out, nothing like that had been done. It rewrote what it means to be a good film. Some years later, ESB challenged what we thought a sequel could be. And now, TLJ yet again takes Star Wars to a bold and interesting place. Because of that, it is the truest Star Wars we have gotten in almost thirty years and holds up to the originals. If you don't go see this movie, as a fan or non-fan alike, you are greatly missing out.\n",

      "I do not normally write reviews, but given the crazy one sided \"this is the greatest movie ever made\" and \"this is the worst movie ever made\" posts, I felt it was my duty.This is not the worst movie by a mile. Nor is it the worst Star Wars movie. However, it does cut close. Let's start with some context. I loved The Force Awakens. I loved the Original Trilogy. I hated the prequels, except Revenge of the Sith. I was not apart of the EU. I wasn't born yet, and to be honest, I am not even sure I understand what the EU really is. Nor am I some woman-hating bigot (that is what some people are using to defend the movie and that is abhorrent). I love love love love love women and support freedom, equal protection, and love for everyone and anyone.Let's start there. Where are the aliens that made Star Wars awesome? I have always loved the diversity of life that Star Wars showcases and was disappointed that none were made important in this film. What little chance there was for Chewie was slowly depleted as he was turned into a fireside joke. Why? This character just lost his best friend and all he can do is eat a porg? I understand they are trying to sell toys but good lord. I hate to break it to you Disney, but \"cool sells.\"I understand there isn't a lot of room in big budget blockbusters but... oh wait a minute there is room because this is literally one of the most expensive movies of the year. Also 30-45 minutes of the movie I saw could have been cut and it would not have affected the film's plot. You think I'm kidding, but I'm really not. The plot was overbloated and why? There was so much territory to cover from The Force Awakens - it was like Rian Johnson sat down and said, \"f- that,\" I am going to make the movie I want to make, regardless of what this other director laid out.Except it is not \"like\" Rian Johnson did that. He \"admittedly\" did that. And that's a really big problem, because cognitive dissonance is totally cool in films that do not have an established framework, but this story did. Not only did TLJ defy TFA. It also defied the prequels and the original trilogy. Purposefully. Dude, when the actor who has played Luke tells you \"that's not Luke,\" you should listen to them. And to top it all off, they killed Luke in post production without him even knowing? Are you actually kidding me right now?Drop dead.All of this is to say that this movie also suffered from problems that had it \"not\" been a Star Wars film, would have made it an even bigger failure. Those failures include convenient plot devices, unnecessary characters who do nothing to further the plot, poor or no character development, changing established rules to fit the plot, etc. The Poe/Holdo situation is a great example of this, but I am not going to spend thirty to forty minutes writing this review, because the film is not worth it.But you are, which is why I have continued this far.All of the performances in this movie are \"spot on.\" From Finn to Rose to Rey to Luke, I loved them all. But unfortunately, being a good actor doesn't make up for mischaracterization. If someone writes against the character you play, that means you still have to act in their version. You can't just walk off the set and say, \"Finn wouldn't do that.\" Part of me wishes they could, because it would have meant a better Star Wars VIII.It would be a very bad idea to have Rian Johnson signed on for the next trilogy. His callous disregard for fan expectations is an affront to the fan base. If anyone from Disney reads this, please understand that this particular decision will cause irreparable damage if it is set in stone. Do not let that happen.And finally, because this is titled \"An Honest Review,\" know that the reason I am giving one star instead of four is to send a message that I - and my family - will not support this movie or future installments made in the same light. We will settle for nothing less than scrubbing it from canon or fixing it via story-telling (all a dream; future-sight; or similar explanation).\n",

      "The beginning of Disney's Star Wars universe was marred by controversy and criticism. I really loved the Force Awakens but I don't feel the need to argue about it or challenge people on their opposite opinion. Its not perfect (just as this movie isn't) but I dug it anyway. Rogue One was also really good and as much as there is so much debate around these movies, I was still excited for this. Rian Johnson is a respected filmmaker and although I'm a little mixed of his filmography, I wanted to give him a shot. The reasons that I loved Episode VII were almost for the polar opposite that I loved The Force Awakens. The Last Jedi has 2 things that they knock out of the park and I must heap loads of praise on Rian Johnson for them. The first is that the characters are developed wonderfully. The Force Awakens introduced some interesting new characters but it was just the beginning, its not like they could go through a deep character arc in just one movie. At first, I was getting frustrated at Luke's downer attitude, self pity seemed unbecoming for him. But as the movie goes along you understand why he's abandoned the Jedi Order and the force as his actions were unbecoming of someone of his legendary status. Kylo Ren isn't just some monster, much like Vader before him, he's not of one mind. The movie plays with the parallels between him and Rey and I loved the fact that they came to a deeper understanding of each other. Leia finally gets to show that she has a measure of ability with the Force, Poe learns what it takes to be a leader, Finn finds out that his bravery wasn't fleeting, and Rey learns about how to look at events from multiple viewpoints and still choose to see the good. You also get new introductions like Vice Admiral Holdo and Rose Tico. Giving us compelling characters isn't new for the Star Wars franchise but this movie was exceptional at giving our heroes and villains more depth and it's even more astounding considering that he wasn't officially involved with the production on Episode VII. It shows how talented Rian is that he could have a deeper understanding of these characters and is just coming into this world.The other thing that this movie deserves credit for is for having genuinely surprising twists and turns in the plot. This movie is not predictable in anyway and even though you may be familiar with these characters, if you told me you exactly guessed the major plot points I would call you a liar. You could guess that Starkiller Base was going to explode and that Rey and Kylo would face off at the end of TFA. This movie dances to a different tune and marches into a different direction and it is much better for it. I think this movie takes very real chances and we need more of that in big budget film making.As this rebooted franchise gains more momentum, the calibre of actors is also continuing to rise. Mark Hamill is solid as Luke, Oscar nomination is a little much but instead of coasting he put in some good work. Carrie Fisher gets a little more to do and she shines. The Force Awakens holdovers are all excellent, Daisy Ridley looks like a rising star again, John Boyega gets to be a little less comedic and he excels, and Adam Driver is good again as the film's antagonist. Laura Dern was a standout, she was the perfect mix of being stern and warm. I still wish Oscar Isaac got more chances to be a bad@$$ pilot but he's still a great actor. I also liked Andy Serkis as Snoke, the guy is so magnetic and he's obviously the best at what he does.So, my review has been nothing but praise but this movie has its flaws. They shoved some of the characters I like best to the back (are we ever going to get a decent amount of time with R2-D2 again?), some of the things that they built up from previous films are just tossed in like they don't matter (I liked the explanation of Rey's heritage but they made it seem like a bigger deal in TFA). The comedy in the movie is a little hit or miss and they hype around certain characters still falls flat (Captain Phasma is completely underwhelming again).I want to wrap this up by saying if you hate this movie and all the Disney produced Star Wars, I honestly think that's fine. But I think people need to try to objectively put aside how amazing the original trilogy was (and me endorsing these movies are not the same thing as denouncing the original films) and judge these movies on their own individual merit. This was a brave step for the franchise and I am now really looking forward to Rian Johnson handling his own trilogy. This was an excellent movie and I recommend you give it a chance.\n",

      "Unlike the most of the people who reviewed the movie as completely garbage I am pretty impressed by it .First of all,the acting was superb.The way Kylo Ren developed from confused boy to a powerful and unwavering sith lord was one of the best things in the plot.He fullfilled his destiny as a sith(killed his Master) and has the ability to force choke-just like his grandfather which is pretty neat-o.Compared to episode 7, he was a freaking master.And he is not even realised his full potential yet.Can't wait to see him in the next movie.I wonder why so many people say that Luke's characters is ruined - it was a great decision of Disney to show us that part of his character showing us that like every human being ,he is capable of making mistakes.I think that Yoda explained that prety ellaborately and still people hate this part of Luke's character.The whole Star Wars movie franchise shows us that everybody makes mistakes at some point(Anakin,Yoda,Obi Wan,Palpatine,Mace Windu etc. ) so why you hate the guy?The fact that he confesses the mistakes he have made and trying to fix this shows us even more his good-hearted nature and wisdom.One thing I was always confuses me is that George Lucas have said that Luke is the strongest force user and yet we have not seen much of his potential(saying that Luke is stronger than Yoda,Palpatine and Vader is pretty confusing) .But this thing he did was f*ckin epic badass sh*t.I was literally amazed.I mean this scene explained to me why he is the most powerful force user ever.The thing that totally dissapointed me was Snoke.I mean wtf is he doing.He was pathetic.Having said that he is stronger than Palpatine is such a garbage. I mean the emperor twisted Vader to the dark side , almost did it with Luke , killed Mace Windu and the other jedi's without a lot of struggle, ruled the galaxy , made everybody fear him.And this guy just comes out of nowhere and tries straight forward to kill Rey who is incredibly strong with the force , not even attemting to make her his apprentice.And finally is beaten in his own game.About the movie , and this is personally my oppinion and interest - I wanted more of the empire theme and more of the jedi-sith battle.Most of the movie shows us the rebellion , the First Order , unlike the other films when we hear the empire march every 5 minutes.All in all the movie is great and worth watching.\n"

      "The Star Wars films are a unique and unusual anomaly in an otherwise saturated lineup of blockbusters in its entire long running history. Other than the fact that it is a huge global phenomenon and the sci-fi classic that most filmmakers wouldn't have possibly conceptualized, it also has a drawbacks because of this status. It's almost as if each movie now have to live to the lightning that the original trilogy caught in a bottle. That there would be certain rules, expectations and certain events that must take place in order for it to be accepted. However, here comes Episode VIII, a film that unequivocally subverts and challenges the very foundations of an already 40 year old saga. It's one of the first Star Wars films, since Empire, that makes us question more about the fundamental themes that drive this saga, while crafting a film that is bold, elegant, emotional and completely thrilling.Let's first tackle the themes and concepts in this film. The theme of letting go of the past is a very prominent one here, and its very apt considering the transition of a new trilogy. We are presented with a flawed, troubled and complex Luke Skywalker, a character that not only rejects the past, but also subverts our expectations of the values we know about him. He's not a jedi that is a master at his craft, he is a legend, a myth and yet he doesn't believe in those things. Here comes Rey, someone who challenges the very notion of what the original trilogy is known to follow. Her character represents the new colliding with an old, draconian and tired way. The other theme relates to the very myths and legends the that the franchise holds. Other than the legend of Luke Skywalker, we are introduced to the myth that there is only a good and bad side, when in reality there is a grey area that lurks beneath. The myth that the jedi have properly restored balance and peace. The myth that it is our identity and past that defines us. With these in mind, The Last Jedi presents these themes in a fully realized fashion, wherein each character has an arc that not only serves them but the entire narrative as a whole. The scenes with Luke/Rey and Kylo are the standout, they no longer represent two opposing forces in the light and the dark, instead they represent distinct ideologies, each trying to pull each other to their ideology by choice, not by some higher order. Each motivation that they have are deeply rooted in personal conflicts within each character. Poe also conveys a strong-willed, cocky and interesting character, one that is confident in everything that he does and it has both its positive sides and down sides. Finn's development from the last film also carries on, as his distrust for the First Order further motivates each decision he makes in the film. Rose is also a worthy addition to the Star Wars roster, one whose character is easy to understand but seemed to have been overshadowed by the larger narrative in play. This film is also just drop dead the most beautiful looking Star Wars film of all time. The Rogue One went places with scale and subtle details, but this film brings a new touch to the universe, it explored places and creatures we've never seen before, yet it doesn't take away from the narrative. Never has Star Wars felt like a film with endless possibilities more than this one, and not just in the sets designs. There is something truly profound about the possibilities that the franchise has opened up to. From the twist in Empire about the family lineage of the Skywalkers, Star Wars became just that, a family space-opera. Yet with the new trilogy, it aims to dissect that very notion and without going too much into spoilers, instead presents something new and innovative that is both a bold and striking message for audiences. If there's any problem I would have with this movie, it is with the choices they made with the story as a whole that seemed to be in relation to appealing to the fans. Now this movie is definitely not the most fan-friendly one, but there are definitely attempts to be. It was like they were obligated to add this side story or have this character be invincible for the sake of being true to Star Wars. While these decisions did not bug me as much, they objectively break some pacing of the film. However, to make up for these is a climax that connected and finally saved those problems from further reaching oblivion. In the end, this is a film that will be remembered as the one that brought this new trilogy into a new direction, the same way that Empire brought the entire franchise into a long stretching family saga. Besides, even Empire Strikes Back had some people scratching their heads when it first opened, it just felt so different from Star Wars. Look where it stands right now, a legend.Verdict: 9.5/10\n",

      "This analysis comes in response to the myriad of reviews here that are bashing the film. And while everyone is entitled to an opinion, I've found the majority of them unsatisfying, in that they barely provide any arguments to support their light critique. It seems that most of these reviewers are content in simply saying that the movie failed to meet their expectations and destroyed a legacy 40 years in the making.I, myself, had great expectations when it comes to The Last Jedi, and oddly enough the film managed to not only meet them, but exceed them in some instances as well. Ryan Johnson has created perhaps the darkest film in the saga, and character deaths have no bearing here. If the darkest film was decided by character deaths, then that laurel would easily go to Rogue One. No, The Last Jedi can be considered dark in great part due to its narrative approach. It is a thematically different film from all the rest - it does away with the duality between good and evil with which we have grown accustomed. It dares to question the legitimacy of established characters, and sets out to demystify the legends that have come to surround some of our favorite characters. This can mainly be seen in Luke, a recluse now, who has grown disillusioned with the Jedi and their dogmatic ways - grown weary by the ramifications of his actions. His struggles along the years and the restoration of the Jedi order have wrought nothing but misery on him and his students, and so he comes to question the validity of the Jedi teachings, and whether they should truly be so absolute. His adherence to the tenants of this religion, coupled with his fear of the darkness growing with Kylo, leads him to consider a drastic course of action - even if it is but a fleeting thought. He is, of course, redeemed in the end, and his character arc comes full circle in a subtle yet engrossing show of force use that saves the remnant resistance.Kylo Ren, himself, is a much more dynamic character here when compared to how he appeared in The Force Awakens. His conflicted nature comes into play again, yet it seems to be much more subtle in The Last Jedi, and Adam Driver does a fabulous job at portraying a tortured soul driven by ambition. His burden is perhaps the heaviest of all to bear. Torn between the colossal expectations that come with being Vader's heir (as well as the legacy behind his bloodline) and the tantalizing salvation which turning to the light side promises, Kylo treads constantly between these two extremes throughout a great part of the movie, keeping the viewer guessing at how this will all play out. Ironically enough, in the end, he does what Vader, for all his might, could not - he outwits his master and slays him effortlessly. In this, he is much more representative of the Old Republic Sith than his grandfather ever was. He takes on the mantle of supreme leader on his own terms. He unshackles himself both from the manipulative Snoke, as well as freeing himself from Vader's legacy; in the end, finally coming into his own - his ambition having bore fruit. 'Let the past die' - as the character would go on to say.Rey's character comes in complete contrast to Kylo's. While both are driven by ambition, Kylo is a fatalist that aspires to free himself all elements of authority and the strain of Vader's legacy, while Rey is an idealist, looking up to legends such as Luke - humbly dreaming of coming into her own, and discovering the catalyst for her newfound abilities. Arguably the most significant aspect of her character arc comes into play on Snoke's ship, where after his death, the two main characters are interlocked in a short but poignant conversation. Kylo's words about her parentage act as a mirror. Much of what drove Rey onward was the potential promise of her own legacy, yet when Kylo demystifies her origins, she is left momentarily broken, her ego shattered - her character shaken to the core, only to be renewed by a newfound strength. Her keenness in the force owes not to any grandiose lineage, but for her own willpower that has carried her so far. In the end, she comes from nothing, and that is what makes her mightyFinn and Poe both have some pretty good character moments. Finn comes into his own alongside the newly established Rose. Their plot-line is arguably the weakest bit in the film, yet it ties quite well at the end of the film, especially the very last scene. Some would argue that their entire side-trip in Canto Bight could have been left out, and I'm somewhat inclined to agree - maybe not completely cut, but perhaps changed somewhat. As it stands, it is indeed on the weaker side of things.\n",
      "Poe on the other hand has some brilliant moments peppered throughout the film's running time, and outside of the main characters, receives the most attention. He really comes into his own in this movie; from fly-boy, and best pilot in the resistance, all the way to assuming the mantle of leadership within the resistance. To that end, both Leia and Holdo instill in him a sense of wisdom to temper his brazen wit; in the process learning the value and cost of sacrifice, and at the same time, learning that martyrdom perhaps isn't always the best course of action. Both Finn and Poe come to understand this as their characters evolve alongside the main narrative.\n",
      "There are, of course, other characters that get some pretty amazing moments - Leia has one in particular, wherein her force powers manifest in ways we haven't seen before; making us wonder if she is perhaps as equally gifted as Luke but untrained, and perhaps uninterested in the particulars of force. Acute force sensitivity is after all a known trait of the Skywalker lineage. With that in mind, the way she manifests the force gives full testament to the namesake.\n"

      "A standout in this all is Andy Serkis as Snoke, who even though has limited screen time, simply dominates the three scenes he appears in. His back and forth with Rey is simply sublime, made all the while greater by a kind of inflection that the actor has mastered. And although he could have used more development (read: development, not background), he is a palpable threat to all his enemies (and his subordinates as well as it turns out). Some have argued that his death is atypical of a major villain, and yet, that is what Ryan does, he plays with viewer expectations, and turns cliches on their heads. Not everyone is bound to receive a ceremonious death, as this would only lessen the magnitude of some of the others.When it comes to cinematography and special effects the film is beyond reproach. A visual treat, The Last Jedi showcases amazing locations, both CGI and real, that blend very well together. Even more impressive are the special effects, which are arguably the best yet seen in a Star Wars film, barring perhaps Rogue One. Here we have Poe's solo run along the fleet destroyer, showcasing maneuvers as we haven't seen since Battlestar Galactica. Of particular note is the moment when Holdo rams the resistance flagship into the First Order's armada, all while initiating Hyperspace. The scene drew gasps in the theater, and for good reason. As it stands, it is perhaps the most visually impressive scene/shot of its kind - across all sci fi films I've seen.Music-wise, John Williams did not disappoint. While the music in TFA was a bit anemic, here the score compliments the action brilliantly, and greatly helps set the tone throughout the film. Beyond that, the sound effects supplement the visual effects harmoniously, and are on par with the best of the preceding movies.I realize that I haven't touched on some subjects, missed some characters, and didn't approach all of the film's themes, however, I mainly wanted to cover the aspects that have been brought into question by others, and to create foundation that implies that his is a truly great film, and perhaps at the same time to champion the thought that we might very well have just witness the best Star Wars film yet. And yes - I'm including Empire Strikes Back here.All in all, the film can be considered a deconstruction of the Star Wars mythos; from republic heroes, to jedi, to the absolutism of good and evil around which each of the previous films revolved - it's an intricate study case of what makes the films great. It does not set out to destroy the legacy, it simply questions the foundations which the narrative and the characters are built upon. Rey's realization that she comes from complete unknowns, yet is so in-tune with the force is the best example here. Wherein this newfound knowledge leads to the death of her ego, and it's beautifully juxtaposed again Kylo Ren's own legacy - which is significant. t's a pity that so many people not only don't appreciate how intricate and good this film is, but outright hate it; all because they can't see past their own expectations. They blame Force Awakens for being a copycat of A NewHope, and yet when a thematically different film comes along they bash it relentlessly. People have been asking for an Old Republic era SW film ever since the first KOTOR released back in 2003. Well this might be the closest we get to that prospect. While it does not take place in the same era, it very much deals with the thematic issues brought about within KOTOR and especially KOTOR2.I for one can't wait to see what Ryan Johnson comes up with next in the newly announced trilogy, because as of now, he is my favorite Star Wars writer/director, and the only one seemingly bold enough to tackle the saga in a different yet poignant way.\n",

      "First of all I am shocked by the reviews written by so-called huge Star Wars fans who rate the movie low while half of them say they have not watched the movie but base their reviews from most of the other reviews and therefore comes to the conclusion that the movie must be bad. In TFA there were many who complained and called the movie unoriginal. The Last Jedi is the opposite, according to some. It is too original and too far away from Star Wars, as we know it. Is it people's aim to hate the movies no matter what? In my opinion the main plot and the subplots of the characters are simple but effective and original, and they work well until they meet. At the same time, the movie has everything Star Wars should have. It is in general mindblowing, it is emotional and it is filled with surprises. The Last Jedi really manages to keep the Star Wars spirit while being innovative on many fronts. The acting from Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are sublime and there are Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver and John Boyega among many delivering amazingly. The movie has impressive sound and the visuals are stunning as well (just look at the Crait Salt Planet).\n",
      "There are many surprises and, perhaps for some, controversial ways the characters are developed, but as Mark Hamill says it's not necessarily bad breaking out of our comfort zone and that we are moving in a new direction with Star Wars.It may not deserve a 10, more like an 8-9, as I disagree with the development of some characters during the film. But I am going with a 10 in opposition to all the 1's because those are extremely unfair. My opinion is that it is definitely among the best Star Wars films.\n",

      "Hello All! I would first like to say that I just created an account just to review this film! This is mainly because I feel so strongly after viewing this film what I think is wrong with hollywood and big block busters today... bad storytelling. Starting off, I am somewhat a fan of Rian Johnsons past work. I recommend Brick to all of my friends and think it is a very well thought out modern Noir story. I even enjoyed Looper which I thought was an imaginative take on time travel. Though a major concern among people who have seen it and some critics is that it is filled with plot holes. Unfortunately it seems as though Mr. Johnson did not read these reviews... I am not a massive star wars fan. I never read the books, the comics or even watched the clone wars television series. I am not a die hard fan for Star Wars. But I am a die hard movie fan. I love movies for their storytelling qualities that let the audience experience something new and different. This major quality that I enjoy most in movies unfortunately is not found in The Last Jedi. Something that I will be referencing throughout this review is the term \"Deus Ex Machina\" which is a term used to describe a \"God Device\" or something found in a plot that arrives just as though a God put it there. I will use it very loosely to point out weak plot points that simply do not make any sense. Other reviews talk about how certain actors act and how some things don't feel right for Star Wars in general. I do not feel like I am knowledgeable enough to point out these flaws. So for all intensive purposes I would like to focus on the story just like I would for any other film. Now to the meat of my review! throughout the film certain things happen in the story that save characters from peril or fix problems they have. Comparing this to real life, we all have had occurrences where something Lucky happens to us and are saved from something horrible. But this does not happen over and over and over again. Starting from the beginning Leia is thrust out into space and is presumed dead. Nowhere in the past films has she been able to observably use the force and mostly can feel things through the force. How is it that right when she is flung to space she manages to not only be able to use the force but can do something that has never even been seen within the franchise? The entire focus in the first act is that the rebels main ship can barely stay out of range from the First Order. How come the First Order doesn't just speed up? Use just a smidge of light speed to cut ahead and become in range? this goes beyond the realm of possibility that they would just drag along behind them and not make the first move when they know they are weak. 3. The entire Finn story line is expendable. It could have never happened and the story could have still ended where it did. When writing I would think that you would look at the story and make sure every single ounce of the story was crucial to get from point A to Point B. Looking at the Finn story it is littered with Deus Ex Machina's for instance when they get arrested. They just so happen to meet someone in the cell who can break into the First Order? Later on, Finn fights Phasma then she happens to fall and die (waste of a character). Then Rose magically arrives with a small ship to get them off the burning ship. Later they crash onto the \"salt planet?\" and manage to be the only ship that gets into the hanger alive. WHAT ARE THE ODDS! I don't want to talk for hours so my last point with Finn is that before Hologram Luke gets barraged with laser canons, Rose passes out. So between Rose passing out and Hologram Luke gets blown to pieces Finn runs across this \"salt field\", Through laser explosions? and gets Rose back to the base in less than 5 miniutes. I'm not even kidding look at the distance between the base, where he landed and the time when Hologram Luke gets attacked. Its ridiculous and makes no sense whatsoever.There are other points I could bring up, like Finn getting rescued last minute by Rose. Snoke just so happened to get out of character and trust Kylo RIGHT AFTER SAYING HE SENSED HIS CONFLICT. Like yep... just said I didn't think you were a full Sith but now I trust you and I'm going to close my eyes. Or the rebels luckily finding an escape root from their new ice fox friends. To conclude, the story is weak because so much happens through blind luck. This is what bad writing looks like everyone! Whenever someone sits down to write there has to be a cause and effect. There is none here. Just cause and luck. It just simply did not make any sense.This does not span to just Star Wars, but all of Disney's films. They lack good story elements that are either extremely predictable or just have random things save them right when they are in trouble. Do not be fooled by the great acting and flashy effects THIS IS BADLY WRITTEN. They say you support something with your money. So from now on I will not be paying to see a Disney owned and operated film for a long time. I am officially fed up with Star Wars, Marvel and dare I say Pixar. Please Disney stop destroying good storytelling and rehashing other peoples ideas!That is all.Thank You if you read all of this!!-TheFlood\n",

      "I didn't expect too much from this chapter, since Disney has acquired Star Wars franchise I wasn't happy about new direction the company has chosen. Don't get me wrong I like Disney, however Disney is good with their own products, but Lucas Arts production definitely isn't what they can neither improve, nor make at least comparable quality. What I saw couple of days ago made my mind explode, the movie that unfolds before your eyes makes you think that it is advertising of some narcotic drug, no seriously I don't know what kind of dope smoked the script writers. First it's the plot, everyone knows that Star Wars has always been full of plotholes and inconsistences and we somewhat got used to it. Last Jedi has no plotholes, because the entire storyline there is a single big hole. The whole movie you do not understand anything, you do not understand why there are so few rebellions and so massive forces of the First Order, where is the victory of the Episode VI? You do not understand who is Snoke and where did he learn his powers; you do not understand why this protagonist girl (I don't even remember her name) has force powers.With age comes wisdom? Well it's not about Luke Skywalker who instead became a ravaging hermit. He doesn't resemble real Skywalker whatsoever. Rather than wise Jedi knight with experience under his belt like Obi-Wan or Yoda for instance, he looks like a little coward and mad psychopath who needs immediate treatment. And this is a hero that used to be a model for many people in the past. Yoda's cameo was incredibly stupid and dull I have nothing more to add, when you see it yourself you will understand why I say that. Princess Lea now doesn't require any oxygen and can fly in space like Mary Poppins, seriously Disney? There are a lot of poor jokes which do not make you even smile; instead they make you think that it's not a Star Wars movie but some parody. Another thing that is worth to mention here is the attempt of creators to make unordinary plot twists. They are ridiculously absurd one of the weirdest one is death of Snoke who couldn't notice how Ben Solo used the force to make a laser sword next to the throne to cut him in a half. It is noticeable that creators tried to make something unordinary at any cost entirely neglecting common sense. I have much better idea for them, in the beginning of the movie Snoke could accidently fall down in a shower banging his head and die, that would definitely be very odd but to put the directors logic it would be a great plot twist indeed!!! And the movie is full of such idiotic Â«twistsÂ», you do not expect them not because they are so unusual, but simply because they are incredibly dumb and you can't imagine something like that stupid happen in the next moment. Not to mention violating even the most primitive laws of physics, like a rebellion who dropped bombs on the starfighter in space and they were falling down like there was a gravity, or how some rebellions could easily survive depressurization in space. There are also plenty of simply stupid moments for instance when the entire First Order fleet chases one rebel ship and can't get it for hours, or how a pilot who was recently demoted for insubordination demands an explanation from the admiral.Any positive moments in the movie? Only Benicio del Toro and Mark Hamill play (he had really stupid character but he played him well). The rest actors didn't show anything impressive. Stunning visual effects. So what? Come on, how can you surprise anyone with visuals in 2017? Technologies today allow making pretty good visuals even in low budget mediocre movies, so this is no longer a distinguishing feature of any sci-fi film. I feel sorry for the franchise, but unfortunately for me it's dead, my only hope now is for good spin-off movies since Rogue One was pretty good. Perhaps Disney producers do not intervene too much in production when it comes to spin-offs, or maybe it's easier to write a decent script for spin-off I have no idea, but whatever the reason is I will wait for a new spin-off and won't go to the cinema for Episode IX that's for sure.\n",

      "I watched this movie last Friday, with high hopes of getting all the answers to the questions I had after watching The Force Awakens. It had been 2 years since that movie was released, after all. I felt we, as viewers, deserved to get at least some questions properly answered.I walked out of the cinema, feeling very confused and underwhelmed.This movie, on it's own or as a part of a trilogy, isn't good. It's watchable, sure, but it's not good. The plot is...boring. The space shuttle runs out of fuel and the rest of the movie is about the rebels trying to get to another currently inhabited planet, that conveniently lies close to their vessel? A character never seen before, which the movie set up to be a traitor whilst Leia was out, sacrifices herself just to save the rebels? Since we don't know anything about this character it didn't make any impact. While we're talking about Leia - since when can she Force fly out of space back into the ship? How the hell did she just enter the ship through the front door without everyone nearby being thrown into space? This will never, ever be explained, as it wasn't addressed in the movie after it happened, and Carrie Fisher sadly passed away after filming of this movie had wrapped up. So they showed this character having incredible powers and everyone were like \"oh, cool.\" Why make that happen if you're not gonna bother explaining that? We've never seen Leia do anything like that before.Then we have the main villain, Snoke. I feel so sorry for all the fans who had these amazing fan theories posted on the internet. They had these good questions we all needed an answer to. Who is he? Where is he from? Is he really more powerful than any other character? All this work these fans put into analyzing every single scene with Snoke in The Force Awakens - for nothing!\n",
      " You would think this movie would at least give a hunch of who this character is. But NOOO, instead they kill him off in the most absurd way possible! I would have accepted if this happened in episode IX, as we would've then gotten some decent development for the character, but now he was killed off before he even got to be a villain!Don't even get me started on Luke. His character was totally wasted in this movie. Not to mention he acted out of character for 95% of the time! He doesn't use the force a single time during the entire movie (unless you count the ending), despite being the last jedi AND training Rey. He doesn't even touch his father's lightsaber, which Rey brought with her. Instead he throws it off a cliff, resolving the 2 year old cliffhanger we got in The Force Awakens in the worst way possible. He passes away at the end of the movie without having gotten any redemption at all for almost killing Kylo Ren. I would've understood that he died if he had done that whilst doing something heroic. Now he went into battle as a hologram, and vanished into thin air on the same island he'd lived on for so many years. So he died alone. People needed his help for the war against the First order and he barely does anything before dying?\n",
      "It was a big mistake killing his character off in this movie. It should have happened in the next movie, if ever. Now we won't have any of the human characters from the original trilogy in Episode IX. It was part of the attraction of this new trilogy, a bit of the old, a bit of the new. And to be honest, these new characters aren't interesting enough to carry the movies on their own. Not in my opinion, at least. What was the dark hole on the island Luke lived on? Why was it an important detail? Nothing happened while Rey was down there. It could've been cut as it was totally uninteresting and provided no answers.\n",
      "The reveal of Rey's parents was a total cop-out. Nobodies? It was hyped up that there was something special about her parents, and in this movie that rumor is debunked as if it was nothing. So underwhelming.The sideplot with Rose and Finn was so boring to watch and brought nothing to the story. It was as if it was impossible for them to find something better for Finn to do, so they made him do just SOMETHING. So silly.\n",
      "When Rose sacrifices herself to save Finn, they make it look like she dies. But then Finn says she needs medical help? Did she die or not? It was never addressed. How did Rose fall in love with Finn so quickly? They barely talked about personal matters, if at all. They hardly knew each other.Even if it was fun to see, Yoda's cameo made no sense. How did he burn that house down if he's dead?I can give this movie some good points too. +1 for great CGI, effects, space battles, acting and soundtrack. That's about it. The movie is way too long and does a poor job at using it's time correctly. I am so sad and disappointed. Force awakens was better and made more sense.\n",

      "This is a bad film. It also neglects the previous film in its own trilogy to take the story on what feels like a different direction. If you watch The Force Awakens to prepare for watching this movie, you're wasting your time. Honesty, the remnant of the First Order is magically in control at the beginning of this movie and every single previous character arc is ignored. Previous character growth is ignored and you may feel frustrated watching them make similar or the same exact mistakes again in this film. Otherwise, you may find that a character's personality is now completely rewritten. Trilogy aside, this film suffers from many plot holes that will cause you to scratch your head at least a couple times. We even took a detour from the movie for a subplot with the lovable Finn and a cool, new character Rose but their portion of the movie dragged on. This detour saved us from having to watch a boring \"chase scene\" between huge starships taking place at a turtle's pace but makes the situation seem just as cheap as the lazy writing that created it. The lack of pace may allow you to ask why things are happening as they are but the story truly falls apart after reflecting back to the film after leaving the theater. The film has some amazing special effects that are just spectacular. For example, the incredible lightsaber fight between young force-users and the final battle scene were pure art. However, the story between the beautiful non-speaking portions fails and hollows the story to not feel epic. I'd say this is a must-see if you loved the previous film/films. I loved The Force Awakens and was ready for another adventure but feel disappointed. This film is where Star Wars \"jumps the shark\" and \"nukes the frig\", and I disgust those scenes... they make me upset. Still, go see the film because you may really like it like many others, but be warned that nearly half of the audiences are not enjoying this film and that is shocking to consider.\n",

      "I think Rian Johnson should give up the new trilogy Disney offered him. The plot has so many holes in it. So many questions unanswered, like who's Snoke? He was able to merge Kylo Ren's and Ray's minds together, but not powerful enough to feel a lightsaber is moving towards him? So many disgusting things about Luke's character. Why did he try to kill Kylo Ren, if he went to try to turn the second most evil man in the universe because he thought there was still good inside of him? Now he acts like a homeless apathetic man. Fans waited 30-40 years to see him on screen again and he dies after two swings from Kylo Ren? Make him kill himself in the island if that's the case. When he was in front of the entire AT AT fleet I thought they were going to show how powerful Luke was, but NOPE. Make the battle! Accept what people are expecting to happen! If he's coming back as a ghost, then he better be the best force ghost ever, not like Yoda or Obi Wan.If you are a diehard star wars fan, realize star wars died when corporate disney wanted to target a younger audience.\n",

      "The story points are so dumb, the humour is very badly put in serious / interesting parts, and the characters are not smart or true to themselves. There are some really good things, but they are massively overshadowed by the bad things. This movie is so much worse than SW7... it's on part with the stupidity of Rogue One's story points and use of characters.SDestroyer would have sent out faster bombers (Tie bombers) to take out the main ship... end of storyThey would have used a droid (eg. BB-8) to hyperspace a smaller ship through the bridge of the bigger ship if that was possible... end of storyLuke maybe was a hermit... okay, I understand his sadness / motivation, but there's no way he would have stayed away... that's not in his nature. You can see him struggle in ESB, but he sees Yoda raise the ship because he doubts and that is why he fails... he would have come around. He would have raised his x-wing from the depths, taken R2-D2, and away he'd follow Rey etc. It is NOT in his character to be mentally defeated like this. It ruins the whole story arc and everything he seems to stand for... and how that DEFINED the star wars experience.Him flinging the lightsaber behind him was soooo stupid. Awkward humour... wrecking the weight of the situation. And this was done again where you should reach for the ___... literal reaching. Dumb humour. Ruining a moment that many fans were waiting for. This type of humour is very misplaced. Some humour is great (eg. han saying tauntauns smell bad on the outside as he's cutting it up... but it will keep you warm). Somebody needs a lesson in how to not mess the feeling of the story up. What the hell? Who okayed this slapstick attempt at humour... AND FROM LUKE??? No... he is not old-yoda.Someone would have taken Admiral __'s placethe infiltration of the SDestroyer was a total waste of time, and the trip to get the master code breaker. I know they freed the horse and the stable boy now has hope, but other than that, the whole story arc was a waste.... and now Rose loves Finn (?)... weakWhat were they trying to accomplish by sending out the super-old skimmers against the mega sized atats???!!! It would have been cool if they had accomplished ANYTHING... maybe brought one down using the acidic dust churned up with the ski... then the atats start to disolve and fall over. Not all of them, then the story kicks back in, but to have them all die basically... just like all the bombers???!!!! What the hell? Nobody (including Poe) is this stupid.-Snoke going into Rey and Kylo's heads and then to facilitate a connection is dumb. That's too powerful... this is why Superman is so much worse of a character than Spider-man. If the character is actually so powerful, it's not interesting. It's cool that Kylo could mask his feelings / thoughts, and that's a great way for him to Darth-Sidious his way into control... but the general way Kylo brings Rey in is so dumb.\n",
      "... there are so many ways this could have gone better. Hey SW... hire me to come up with ideas. This stuff you're doing is not reasonable.\n",
      "eg. If Luke doesn't want to be found, what the hell is the map in SW7 for and who made it!?... and if Luke didn't turn R2D2 back on, are you telling me the force turned him on? It's more awesome if Luke does it... and it's more in line with his character.\n",
      "... which is something that is absolutely ignored in SW8 (SW7 was mostly great, but SW8 is so much worse because of problems that SEEM small to you guys in production).BB-9E should have battled BB-8, or at least BB-8 could have taken him out with the ATST... anything???? nope. Huge FUN Star Wars opportunity LOST! There are so many things you could have done to make it FUN and star warsy... nope. Such a waste.so where did Snoke come from?... nothing... not even a little bit? - great movie plot opportunity lost.how did Snoke find Kylo?... nothing? - great movie plot opportunity lost.knights of Ren?... nothing? - great movie plot opportunity lost.Snoke in SW7 acts like being the master of the knights of ren is a big deal... but in this movie, he's scolding Kylo for wearing a helmet JUST like the knights of ren do. - sooooo stupid.... have someone check for consistency!!!!!... it matters!Chewy leads the tie fighters away... skier speeders still all get destroyed. - whole thing, flying under the surface basically pointlessPoe's revelation about winning a battle where almost everyone dies (bombers all die) is so absolutely dumb. From SW7, he's a smart clever guy. There's no way he could have thought that was okay... and there's no way he values life so little (eg. seeing Finn or BB-8 again). Give me a BREAK! There's no way he'd be okay seeing numerous friends in the bombers just die. This story is retarded. Someone must see this was a mistake!??... and in SW4-6, it was a big deal going out to war... everyone busy and helping and comerarery...... nothing? - great movie plot opportunity lost. (I know it was the beginning of the movie, but still)It was great how Poe took out all the guns before the bombers came. It would have been better to see the bombers accomplish anything before all-but-one died. So, in summary, ALL the bombers blew up for that ONE bad-guy ship... and Poe was okay with those odds? No. Anyone can see this is stupid.The bombers could have swooped around at least a little (?), and maybe bombed something with little results to validate their numbers and hulking existance. So stupid... but you guys get to sell toys. And all the kids can go - watch my bomber blow up without doing anything too! (you should put that in the commercials... that's the intelligence level you're aiming at). They all die without doing anything!!!???... except for one that uses gravity in space with the bomb doors open (?) for the remote to fall and then the bombs fall. Come on! Ask anyone to fact-check any of this (even within what's sci-fi reasonable). There are other ways you could have accomplished this without it being so dumb.Why the hell is there a remote for the bombs? The control would be in the control panel. This is on the same level of stupid as the *other* computer for alignment in Rogue One where she has to walk out on a catwalk and then nearly fall etc.Luke almost didn't help Rey with any training... and now she knows all that's in the books? Wow. - HUGE opportunities lost to make the story WAY more interesting. I can't say how stupid this is... so many interesting ways to go, and at least leave the door open for more in future movies? Why does yoda say she knows all she needs?... so she's a Jedi after learning 2 things (can't remember the 3rd), and not getting any lightsaber form training from Luke... or anything else (no standing on your head and levitating rocks type of cool challenges?). I would have loved something more. It's like you guys meant to jump the shark on purpose... but why? Why truncate what could have been the coolest part of the movie for many fans who love the mystery of what a Jedi is and how they become one. So it's 3 steps... that's it? Done?the black hole under the island... it's a mirror. Come on!!!!!!!! That could have been epic if there was actually something profound (eg. the SW5 tree where Luke fights vader and ends up seeing himself in his perceived enemy). Where the hell is the profoundness / message in seeing a reflection of yourself off into the distance that \"is not infinite\"... then we get to the 'end'... and it's still just you. No revelations about parents, or the force, or even ANYTHING about the darkness down there. ... nothing? - great movie plot opportunity lost. Huge fun opportunity lost.SW is supposed to have fun stuff (like Poe taking out the cannons), but there should be a force-luck-related reason. So, Rey gets pulled into the black hole, goes for a swim, sees many reflections of herself, and then climbs back up and tells Luke about it. That's so dumb and pointless.the use of 2D characters is about on par with how bad Rogue One was in the story / logic department.Rogue One was GREAT for space battles, but there's the story and the logic behind character motivations... and then there's the FUN that must be in every Star Wars movie.I hope SW9 does this better. Someone should have dealt with the stupid Michael-Bay type jokes that ruin the feeling of the movie. I can't believe nobody caught this or fealt strongly how I do. It's so weird that these 'jokes' made their way in... there are not many, but they are profoundly wrong and they STRONGLY pull you out of the moment (eg. learning about the force... JOKE!)... you have cancer... JOKE! There are good times for jokes and bad times for jokes. Learn the difference.Spend MORE time on the small things (interesting story points, consistency, etc.) rather than spending little time on everything (and ignoring the character motivations?). SW7 was so much better in this regard. It was completely FULL of quality content (much more than people claim).Great special effects alone does not make a movie good... eg. Rogue One.You need more good clever ideas to build the characters and the plot (with a story that makes sense) while maintaining continuity and allowing characters to be true to themselves. Hire me for ideas! I'd love to help.There are so many problems with this movie that overall wreck it hard, but there are great things too...Great things:\n",

Why does yoda say she knows all she needs?... so she's a Jedi after learning 2 things (can't remember the 3rd), and not getting any lightsaber form training from Luke... or anything else (no standing on your head and levitating rocks type of cool challenges?). I would have loved something more. It's like you guys meant to jump the shark on purpose... but why? Why truncate what could have been the coolest part of the movie for many fans who love the mystery of what a Jedi is and how they become one. So it's 3 steps... that's it? Done?the black hole under the island... it's a mirror. Come on!!!!!!!! That could have been epic if there was actually something profound (eg. the SW5 tree where Luke fights vader and ends up seeing himself in his perceived enemy). Where the hell is the profoundness / message in seeing a reflection of yourself off into the distance that \"is not infinite\"... then we get to the 'end'... and it's still just you. No revelations about parents, or the force, or even ANYTHING about the darkness down there. ... nothing? - great movie plot opportunity lost. Huge fun opportunity lost.SW is supposed to have fun stuff (like Poe taking out the cannons), but there should be a force-luck-related reason. So, Rey gets pulled into the black hole, goes for a swim, sees many reflections of herself, and then climbs back up and tells Luke about it. That's so dumb and pointless.the use of 2D characters is about on par with how bad Rogue One was in the story / logic department.Rogue One was GREAT for space battles, but there's the story and the logic behind character motivations... and then there's the FUN that must be in every Star Wars movie.I hope SW9 does this better. Someone should have dealt with the stupid Michael-Bay type jokes that ruin the feeling of the movie. I can't believe nobody caught this or fealt strongly how I do. It's so weird that these 'jokes' made their way in... there are not many, but they are profoundly wrong and they STRONGLY pull you out of the moment (eg. learning about the force... JOKE!)... you have cancer... JOKE! There are good times for jokes and bad times for jokes. Learn the difference.There are so many problems with this movie that overall wreck it hard, but there are great things too...Great things:\n"

      "Many of the user reviews I see here are trolling reviews created to counter the fake glowing positive review from the Critics. The 1/10 or 3/10 ratings seem over the top, because there are good elements of the movie, but this movie deserves no higher than a 6/10 in my opinion. The problems of this movie for me:First space battle where multiple Stardestroyer ships escorting a Dreadnaught ship do nothing while Poe single-handedly takes out the Dreadnaught defenses. Even the Dreadnaught ship waits until if becomes defenseless to the incoming bombers to send out and TIE fighters. Why even have the stardestroyers there? It seems they were only there so General Hux could be present to take part in a joke and to survive the Dreadnaught destruction because he is on a separate ship. The whole sequence is stupid, and ultimately only exists to set up some character depth for Rose. The rest of the movie continues the same, illogical space battles, illogical space chase, illogical ground battles, Rey spending more time Skyping Kylo Ren than talking training with Luke, pointless secret mission to a casino, etc. The forced chemistry/romance between Rey and Kylo is similar to Anakin and Padme, just there because it's what the story calls for but no believable natural chemistry like what we saw with Han and Leia or even Luke and Leia for a brief moment in the original trilogy.The movie has too many jokes/funny moments that are set up rather than seeming to occurring organically. Positives are we get to see the Force used in new powerful ways, we get to see new cool First Order weapons and ships.Honestly during the movie there are parts that confuse you or make you wonder why things are happening the way they are, but you move past that because you're trying to enjoy the new Star Wars movie. And you can enjoy the visuals and special effects and some of the characters. So basically if you don't think about it it's a great movie, but when you do think about it, it just gets worse and worse.\n",

      "I'm seeing a lot of just completely negative responses to this film on here, so I thought it was important for the other side to speak their peace so that many do not read reviews thinking it's all over and everything has gone to hell for the Star Wars universe. Firstly, this film is very funny, and i'm *not* really sure what the heck other people are surprised about. I mean this is coming from the same universe that has given us Jar Jar Binks (whomst I do not like), Ewoks and all manner of silly droid comic relief characters. This film is a vast improvement in its use of comedy overall compared to the previous films, except for Han Solo because he will almost be the most hilarious. The plot, admittedly is strange and plot-holey however.... guys. This is coming... *again* from the universe who gave us the Death Star and its magic 'splode button (although that was thankfully ret-conned in Rogue One.) There are plenty of \"Thats not how SCIENCE works!\" (see what I did there) moments and *every* other Star Wars movie is like that. Think back to when Obi-Wan and Anakin have a 15 minute lightsaber duel on Mustafar above Lava that would literally burn their skin off if they were that close to it, just so that it looks *cool*. Also they ride like... pieces of floating metal over the lava like hover boards... how. does that make sense? But, idk, it looks awesome so I just said, you know. It's fine. So why can't we do the same thing for this movie. Why are we being THIS hard on this one particular iteration of the universe.... hmmm? I wonder... could it be perhaps because it has unusually strong female and non-white characters and a deeply anti-status quo theme? Idk, I don't wanna believe Star Wars fans are that stupid, but I feel like the complaints about this movie that I see are dancing around that being their underlying complaint...For instance, name a character in the Star Wars universe who is magically good at everything without having trained for more than about 15 minutes, and then goes to a suicide mission after having a *vision*. \n"

      "Were you thinking the answer to that was Rey? Because Luke fits that exact same description. Luke trains for 15 minutes on Dagoba with Yoda, then freaks out and has to bounce, but is somehow a god with a saber..... But it's okay. Cause he is a dude. I mean, overall this film has wicked cool special effects, epic dog fights (not real dogs... i'm talking about the ships), kickass new characters who do all kinds of crazy things that I feel only serve to expand Star Wars canon. Canto Bight was a plot device to expose the seedy underbelly of the bipartisan crooked elite, something we see ALL THE TIME IN THE NOVELS but never in the movies! Furthermore, this film decided to play with the whole concept of light versus dark, the epic black and white cut and dry, us and them mentality that has driven the plot of the last 7 movies before it, I mean come on!!! Didn't you guys want something fresh and new? Take for instance the new understanding of the Force, one of a way of life, of spirituality and depth of emotion, instead of \"let's test em for midichlorians\", something that even the expanded universe never really made good use of anyway. Stupid concept that makes only the genetically worthy able to be cast as \"Jedi\" or \"Sith\" by special blood. This movie expanded upon our ideas of the force even more than any previous Star Wars film... it introduced Force Sensitivity as a concept, and the Force being a spiritual understanding and depth. It made FORCE SENSITIVE LEIA Canon! I mean come on, that's freaking awesome. This movie is full of badass beautiful women taking on the elite ruling class of war mongering imperialists and shedding a whole new light on the idea of a Resistance in general. Instead of a bunch of white, pasty guys with beards flying the X-Wings into battle you have Indian women, Asian women, and all manner of different looking beautiful people taking the Resistance into their own hands for once. Anyway, this is running long, but I think this movie did a great job building badass Star Wars terrains, Crait, Canto Bight and Ach-to and introducing interesting, relatable people, Rose, Codebreaker and Holdo. The only major problems that I have with it are the fact that the First Order could have easily just boosted their jets a bit to reach up to the Resistance Cruiser, but like I said....... Death Star 'splode button. And the fact that it should've been Leia who sliced Snoke's ship in half out of epic sacrifice. I have other minor issues, but not enough to warrant giving this a freaking 1 Star.\n",

It is sad to see/hear this from such a fan like Dash. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gLsukihjVg&feature=shareHere are most of my negative points:\n",
      "Something that i didn't like already in TFA, the Resistance is an extremely small military force (if one can call it that). Not even the Rebellion was that small in its early days in such harsh/dire circumstances. In TLJ they are even more ridiculous.No politics, no New Republic current situation nor the galaxy's as a whole for that matter. The New Republic was heavily demilitarized but damn, don't they have other forces throughout the Galaxy! -.-'One single fighter takes out a 7 km long Mandator Dreadnaught's 26 point-defense laser cannons specially built to deal with such craft. Ney!Hux is even more incompetent, coward, and stupid than before. He does not convey a proper \"imperial\" officer attitude nor depth of a Tarkin or Krennic type for example. The only FO officer that stood out, albeit briefly, was Captain Canady. I loved that character.The bigger part of the film is a \"Battlestar Galactica\" chase.I can't digest that a ship such as the Supremacy couldn't destroy 4 ships once it came out of lightspeed nor why didn't the FO sent the Resurgents or even swarms of TIE Fighters and Bombers alongside Kylo to catch up and put an end to the Resistence. The FO capital ships are toned down on one side and 4 TIEs (including Ren's) are capable of inflicting such damage to the Raddus. -.-'Admiral Ackbar (love that character) is even more irrelevant this time. Where is his tactical genius? DEAD! R.I.P. Sucked into space just like that! -.-' He should have been the one to pilot the Raddus in the end and, by doing so, he would have gone out in glory and Holdo could have lived.I can accept that Leia survives the vacuum of space, hell, Vader survived being burned to a crisp and other Force users are known to do impossible things in both canon and legends, but the way that scene was done. Ney! Porgs should have been toned down a bit, they are cute and funny but overused in my opinion.Canto Bight and all the subplot of Finn and Rose is crap! I think that their mission plot could have been \"saved\" if, in the end, DJ had had a change of heart, like solo in ANH, taken control of the FO ST and saved them. Unfortunately, DJ was just another wasted character. In the end, That subplot brought nothing but distraction to the story as a whole.I can accept that Snoke was not important to Rian Johnson and others, but the character should have gone out in a more impressive way. Such powerful and mysterious being sliced in half by a sleazy cheesy trick with a lightsaber!? Really!? NEYYYY!Phasma, OMFG!! Ultra mega disappointment!!!!Why do they keep messing with Yoda. GOSH! Puppet Yoda worked great in the OT and CGI Yoda in the PT, why mix both and have that hideous thing. If they've made such a great job with Snoke and Maz, why not making a state of the art CGI Yoda.That hyperspace suicide move from Holdo (another excellent and wasted character) left me with mixed feelings. A ship powerful as the Supremacy being destroyed like that... oh man. There is a precedent of a sort, in legends when Admiral Griff orders his and another 2 ISDs to jump into hyperspace and accidentally collide with the Executor bringing down its shields and disabling it for some time but not destroying it.(https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/8/8f/GriffMeetsExecutor-CSW.png/revision/latest?cb=20150112001227) I expected another kind of spectacular demise to that ship.The whole Battle of Crait was another wasted event that could have been great. The set was staged for such an awesome land battle but no. 13 falling apart junk speeders against such a massive FO invasion force that result in nothing but waste of life and accomplish nothing.Finns junk speeder manages to hold against that super cannon beam!?!?!? Another crap!Mary Sue saves the day by diverting all the TIEs from the battle and destroying them! -.-'Luke dies without some fight. He should have fought a bit, even though as a projection to stall Kylo even more, while at the same time, add more depth/credibility to the tremendous power he was using culminating in his death by overtaxing his body, and giving us fans a memorable go \"down fighting\" moment. The Falcon leaves Crait without any fight. Holdo managed to destroy all FO forces in that strike? No! Otherwise where the hell did the invasion force come. In the end everyone is happy like nothing has happened. -.-'May the Force be with Star Wars.\n",

How does someone with such a poor resume get the execs at Disney to let them even ATTEMPT to take on this challenge? What kind of pitch could someone give to write AND direct such important and valuable IP when they essentially have the equivalent experience of writing two episodes of LA Law, directing Deathstalker V, and a doing poorly received arthouse flick? He must have some profound connections, or a whole lot of dirt on someone. His prime directive appears to be this: destroy everything sacred in the Star Wars universe, make TFA entirely pointless, and raise two middle fingers to everyone who doesn't like it. Some sick combination of jealousy and narcissism apparently made him want to set J.J. Abrams up for failure: Episode IX is the movie that is going to see the HUGE box office drop due to the pointless fan slapping done in this film. TFA was great, the buzz for the next installment was unbelievable. The Internet was wild with rumors and theories and hope for the next installment. Many people (myself included) bought tickets for TLJ months in advance... which meant sold out theaters and a huge opening weekend no matter what. Rian knew he could do whatever he wanted and still walk away claiming it was a big success based on that data alone. Well, the capital built in TFA is now wasted after TLJ.

Ignoring character exposition with the excuse that Lucas didn't explain the Emperor until the prequels is bogus. We saw the prequels to these films... all SIX OF THEM. He didn't just poof into existence and rule the galaxy. Give me a break man! All that time hoping his projected image from TFA was a Wizard of Oz created by a dark and twisted Jar-Jar Binks.

The US is fuming with extremists on each side, who are pissing off everyone else across the political spectrum on a daily (if not hourly) basis. I am confident that all the dog-whistles people are perceiving are more a projection of how they see the world (and see those who oppose whatever their views are) in light of all the heightened polarization today. Criticism that this movie is anti-men, because of the (absolutely amazing!) female leads is totally disgusting. You could level the same criticism at A Nightmare On Elm Street 3. How about \"all rich people are evil\" - go watch Toxic Avenger through that lens and get your mind blown. Carefully hidden PETA-like messaging triggering you?

      "The future of the Force and the meaning of this awakening is cemented in this film. Much of the back and forth with Kylo and Rey touch on an odd idea. Could the Force be beyond good and evil / light and dark. Did Skywalker bloodline bring \"balance to the force\"... by destroying the Jedi Order AND The Sith? Not a balance of light vs. dark, but a new balance of light and dark into one? We watch as the old established orders meet their end. The orthodox religion of the force dies with Luke in the shadow of the first Jedi temple. A new religion, understanding, being-ness of the Force is about to take hold on the galaxy.\n",

      "Failure itself is a huge message in this film. Every sub plot in the film totally failed, and did so _intentionally_ to drive the message home that failure is a greater teacher then success.

Something has to change, and I think we are seeing hints of that in this film. \n",
      "\n",
      "The final scene was epic. I certainly have friends who disagree, but the passing of the torch to a new generation without the orthodoxy, rigor, and establishment of the previous Jedi Order is a big deal. This is a new religion of the Force being written -- one without books and teachers. One which has to be experienced and developed by new chosen disciples. I was one of those fans who really hated how the prequels moved the Force from being a tremendous supernatural Zen/Tao-like power flowing through all things and open to anyone... to being a product of microscopic intelligent parasites living in the blood of a chosen few. Midi-chlorian blood tests be damned, I want the Force to be a mystical energy once again. I hope this \"awakening\" now means everyone may be able to tap into the Force without being born into it with the right bloodline, or just by having a nasty parasite infection. It appears that may be the case as the Force itself is reaching out and mystically choosing a new legion of force users to replace the old generation. Speculation maybe, but I have hope.\n",

I'm excited and hopeful for the conclusion to this arc, and what it means for the franchise. Rian certainly did his best to burn it all down, but he can't kill Star Wars so easily.

      "\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" was a huge disappointment to a long time \"Star Wars\" fan such as myself. Okay, here we go.The rebel Resistance are on the run, hunted down by the evil First Order ruled by the Dark Side. Daisy Ridley, who plays a young woman strong with The Force, seeks a Jedi master (Mark Hamill) who is in hiding; and begs him to help with the fight against the First Order and maybe train her to be a Jedi - sounds a bit like \"The Empire Strikes Back\" right? Why not, as \"The Force Awakens\" was similar to \"A New Hope.\"Then there is the puzzling and badly written (which fits right in with the rest of the movie which revels in its mediocrity and goofball jokes) subplot involving two Resistance fighters going to a casino to find a person who excels in hacking stuff so they can bring him back to the bad guys' main ship to sneak in unnoticed and destroy some gizmo that allows the bad dudes to track the Resistance fleet - what's left of it - even in hyperspace. Destroy the gizmo, and the Resistance can zoom away and escape to fight another day. But that may not be necessary because the leader of the rebel fleet intends to abandon the main ship and use escape transports to sneak into a planet that has been abandoned but has an old rebel base there. Oh, the escape transports have a cloaking device to keep the bad guys from seeing them on their monitors...but...you can still see the escape ships! Yes, the rebel fleet are miles from the bad guys' ships, but are you telling me there is no one on the bad guys' bridge with a super duper binocular to get an up close and personal view of what the good guys are doing? At this point I may as well continue with my beef with this movie.The opening sequence, which was very good in a menacing way, was completely ruined by jokes.John Boyega, playing a Resistance fighter and the only black guy with a significant role in this movie, is still a damn clown.Hamill's character was handled badly. The movie tried to make him look like a tragic character, something out of a Shakespeare story; but the writer, who is also the director, mangled the job so badly that Hamill came off as a blubbering fool. In his first appearance of \"The Last Jedi,\" Hamill casually tosses his lightsaber behind him like a half eaten apple. What a great way to start destroying a character that could have added sorely needed darkness and depth to this movie. I understand that this movie is supposed to demystify the Jedis; but by doing that the writer/director/producers/studios are destroying the essence of \"Star Wars.\" On top of that, demystifying the Jedis was done in a half-assed way, so the result is a double whammy.There was no interesting lightsaber fight. None. The one with Ridley inside the Supreme Leader's throne room looked like something out of a second day rehearsal. As for the last lightsaber duel, it doesn't even count - I can't say why or else I'd spoil a big surprise.

      "\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" was a huge disappointment to a long time \"Star Wars\" fan such as myself. Okay, here we go.The rebel Resistance are on the run, hunted down by the evil First Order ruled by the Dark Side. Daisy Ridley, who plays a young woman strong with The Force, seeks a Jedi master (Mark Hamill) who is in hiding; and begs him to help with the fight against the First Order and maybe train her to be a Jedi -- sounds a bit like \"The Empire Strikes Back\" right? Why not, as \"The Force Awakens\" was similar to \"A New Hope.\"Then there is the puzzling and badly written (which fits right in with the rest of the movie which revels in its mediocrity and goofball jokes) subplot involving two Resistance fighters going to a casino to find a person who excels in hacking stuff so they can bring him back to the bad guys' main ship to sneak in unnoticed and destroy some gizmo that allows the bad dudes to track the Resistance fleet -- what's left of it -- even in hyperspace. Destroy the gizmo, and the Resistance can zoom away and escape to fight another day. But that may not be necessary because the leader of the rebel fleet intends to abandon the main ship and use escape transports to sneak into a planet that has been abandoned but has an old rebel base there. Oh, the escape transports have a cloaking device to keep the bad guys from seeing them on their monitors...but...you can still see the escape ships! Yes, the rebel fleet are miles from the bad guys' ships, but are you telling me there is no one on the bad guys' bridge with a super duper binocular to get an up close and personal view of what the good guys are doing? At this point I may as well continue with my beef with this movie.The opening sequence, which was very good in a menacing way, was completely ruined by jokes.John Boyega, playing a Resistance fighter and the only black guy with a significant role in this movie, is still a damn clown.Hamill's character was handled badly. The movie tried to make him look like a tragic character, something out of a Shakespeare story; but the writer, who is also the director, mangled the job so badly that Hamill came off as a blubbering fool. In his first appearance of \"The Last Jedi,\" Hamill casually tosses his lightsaber behind him like a half eaten apple. What a great way to start destroying a character that could have added sorely needed darkness and depth to this movie. I understand that this movie is supposed to demystify the Jedis; but by doing that the writer/director/producers/studios are destroying the essence of \"Star Wars.\" On top of that, demystifying the Jedis was done in a half-assed way, so the result is a double whammy.There was no interesting lightsaber fight. None. The one with Ridley inside the Supreme Leader's throne room looked like something out of a second day rehearsal. As for the last lightsaber duel, it doesn't even count -- I can't say why or else I'd spoil a big surprise. A great lightsaber fight sequence could have saved this movie, but there was none.There were too many elements stolen from \"A New Hope,\" \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" and \"Return Of The Jedi.\"Ridley's character is hinted as someone who already knows the way to being a Jedi, and she can continue without Hamill training her and be fine.

      "I was really disheartened by the reviews by users after having seen the glowing critic reviews of this title. Words like 'franchise killer', 'worse than the prequels' and 'mindnumbingly bad' were being thrown around like wildfire. Avoiding the spoilers was like trying to avoid grass in a field. This review will contain spoilers to back up my statements.Star Wars: The Last Jedi picks up immediately where episode VII left off, with our new characters all up to many exciting things. We were looking forward to Rey's jedi training, Luke's story since episode 6, Finn's continued badass-ness and so on. For the most part, we got exactly that, but this movie falls flat in terms of how each of these stories were weighted. Rey's training was only 2 scenes, while the reveal of Luke's sudden (and inconsistent) need to kill Kylo Ren as a child due to fear of him being evil was did not sit very well with me. On the positive, Finn's arc was great fun, although the romantic element was a bit odd. In terms of continued character development, along with the introduction of new characters, this movie does well. We learn to love Rey that little bit more. Kylo Ren is a bit of an oddity. Is he really evil? Is he confused? This movie does well to continue to develop this element and made the twists and turns that followed all the more exciting. Luke, however, takes a bit of a backseat. I (and many others) wanted to see more of Luke and learn more about how the hell he ended up on this island. However, it appears the production team want us to sway away from the old cast and focus on the new generation. If you think about it, this has happened before. Yoda was huge in the prequels, yet his presence in episodes 4-6 is overshadowed by new characters. The same can be said with Obi-Wan in episode 4. So for people hating on this, try and rationalise the reasoning.Now onto the specific issues I had with this movie. Let's forgo the 'Mary Poppins' reference to Princess Leia in space (although it was a bit odd) and focus on two things that grated with me. Firstly, since the Marvel era, many movies want to add comedic elements to an otherwise serious storyline. It works for Marvel movies, but not very well in other cases. Take the 2017 release 'Justice League' where they tried to copy Marvel and it not only made the comedy feel forced, but also misplaced. The same is true here. Jokes don't need to be inserted all the time guys! The second thing was the final plot twist that Luke sent a Jedi Shadow of himself to fight Kylo Ren. However, after this pseudo-fight, Luke dies. If Luke was intending on dying in the first place, why on Earth did he bother sending the shadow? Hmm.All in all, Star Wars: The Last Jedi was a good movie. I enjoyed watching it as an average movie-goer. Sure, there are story elements that could have been done better, but I think they did a darn good job. Just because they have not followed through with all the fan theories does not mean they deserve such hate. Enjoy it for what it is, a great space opera!\n",

      "Directors seem to often have to make a trade-off between sticking to the Star Wars canon and lore on one side and creating a new piece of art on the other. Regardless in what order you rate the original Trilogy (OT), they seem to have (mostly) struck the right balance between these two extremes. Hence the rabbit multi-decade fandom. Arguably Star Wars fans put up with Episodes 1 to 3, because even though they were terrible films, they paid homage to the universe. You felt that you were, even kind of, watching a Star Wars movie. The Force Awakens drew criticism for basically following the same plot as A New Hope. Yet seemed to generally win over fans by mostly striking this balance. Paying homage to the old (too much for some) but introducing the new.Mr Johnson has been lined up for his own trilogy of the Star Wars Universe. A storyline that would be separate from the known characters and old plots. It feels like he decided to jump the gun and impose his own take now on the OT storyline. The Last Jedi is very much nihilistic take on all characters, canon and lore you loved. There is no way that Mr Johnson could have been a Star Wars fan given the lips service he gives to every one of the old characters. If you are new to Star Wars you'll like this film. It's a fun Sci-Fi Adventure. If are not new and actually like Star Wars, prepare to have most of the characters destroyed. Judging the film on it's own it definitely had some strong cinematography. There were also solid performances from some of the actors.\n"

      "However, the film had very strange humour throughout, which did not land once with a packed audience in my cinema. There were strange plot directions and twists that took characters on journeys purely, it seemed, to introduce bad CGI. There were some incredible continuity errors. (Like dropping bombs in zero gravity space). A villain that, in my mind, lacks any depth. And lastly, what I have seen and tend to agree with. A complete re-writing of the Luke Skywalker character. I am not a rabbit fanboy of the films. Only someone that grew up with the original Trilogy. I really just could not make the mental leaps we were asked to make. A character whose arc involved aiming to save his evil father years later wanting to murder his nephew.I completely understand that Disney and Mr Johnson wanted to spark the interest in a new generation of fans. The entire film was exactly about that. Yet it seemed pointless to have these old characters involved at all then. I can honestly say that this Director has killed the franchise for me. I sat through all the terrible prequels hoping that the next one would be good. The Force Awakens and Rogue One, I thought, were great steps to revive the franchise. I have no interest in seeing the last film. For Star Wars fans, thinking about seeing this film I would advise not to. For anyone that likes Sci-Fi and CGI, you should be okay.\n",

      "Okay. So I went to see \"The Last Jedi\" a second time to get it all straight in my head. Noticed some more details that were easy to miss the first time, such as more consistency (but also some more inconsistency) in the overall intent of the movie.The big point of the movie clearly seems to be to transfer the heroic agency from the Jedi to the Resistance. The normal men and women (and slave children) of the Resistance are the true heroes, and will rise to glory in the next movie (where sympathizers from hundreds of systems will no doubt heed the call, accidentally delayed, no doubt, only by a small hyperspace traffic jam), rebuilding the movement, aided by Rey and maybe a few more appropriately humble Force users on the sidelines.I continue to disagree with almost all aspects of the underlying philosophy of this movie, however, which has the depth of sage American high school instruction along the lines of \"Pessimism is like a glass half empty! Optimism is like a glass half full!! Whoa, that's so profound!!\" What we see so painfully clearly in \"The Last Jedi\" is a philosophical position regenerated in many American movies: that, given the choice between saving the lives of a large group of people who are not your personal loved ones, and the lives of one or two of the people closest to you, you should always and absolutely just save the few people (or the one) closest to you. Which is, of course (as Mr. Spock knows), WRONG. It proceeds from the bourgeois sphere of empathy which only includes your immediate family and friends. A true hero's sphere of empathy and understanding of human worth include ALL people equally; he does not make exceptions for those who happen to be his intimates.This tendency reaches its most visible zenith in the scene where Rose kisses Finn while the portal to the rebel base explodes in the background. \"Let's be selfish and perhaps even aroused while the people we were supposed to save die horribly in the distance.\" This is one of the most anti-heroic scenes of all time! It made me cringe, feel pain and go \"Ew!\" But it gets far worse: Luke's entire position in this movie is just another version of the same thing! Because he felt called upon to (almost) sacrifice one of his own intimates (his nephew, Ben Solo, for good reason), his reaction was to leave the rest of the galaxy in the lurch, rejecting his responsibility (and, initially, natural inclination) to help the Resistance against The First Order. He stopped caring about the many people who depended on him because of a traumatic experience with one person close to him. Which is weak and unheroic. As Mark Hamill knows, Luke Skywalker wouldn't behave like that on his worst day.Now, stay with me for this next bit of Johnson logic. Rian Johnson's view (as perpetuated by Luke in the new movie) is that the Jedi are to blame for the rise of the Sith in the older movies. Like, the Jedi were not heroic *enough*; they failed ONCE after a stable 1000-year reign of the Republic, and this suddenly makes them vain and unworthy of their special status. BUT, these movies are also very much about the prophecy of the balance of the Force. The breaking in half of Luke's light-saber clearly shows that Kylo and Rey's powers are precisely equal. There can be no doubt that they will enter into a balance, a state of harmony (with the help of the Force Ghost of Luke), at the end of the next movie. Which all means that the Force guides people's destiny. Otherwise there couldn't be a prophecy which came true. If there are destinies, there can't be much free will. If there is no free will, then the Jedi cannot be blamed for the rise of the Sith. It's all just down to the Force balancing itself. So it's inconsistent logic to blame the Jedi. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE JEDI. Hence, Luke (and especially Yoda - talk about \"shits and giggles\"!) is behaving wildly out of character in this movie.Then, to specifically examine the progressive value in this movie, let's look at the societies of the Star Wars galaxy. When the Jedi were great symbols of heroism, the nature of the societies didn't greatly matter to the artistic substance of the story. Because if great heroes win the day, the implication is that society will be reborn according to heroic morals. And in the old movies it was easy to interpret the Empire as the equivalent to our local imperialist hegemony: the exact capitalist society in which we live (which was also Lucas' original intentions, as per the Rebel Alliance being conceived as the Vietnamese of the Vietnam War). But if the heroes are just normal representatives of the given society, then their victory only implies the victory of that society's values. Therefore, the nature of the narrative's fictional society matters a great deal to the progressive content of the story. There are three types of society and concomitant values: right-wing, center and left-wing. Corresponding to: Slave economy (fascism and racism, now mostly belonging to our historical past), bourgeois merchant rule (current capitalism and profiteering) and classless, moneyless democracy (the heroic humanism that will emerge in the future).Proper heroes, in order to be in any way progressively anti-establishment and provide role models for how we should evolve socially in the future, can only represent the last of these. But in a Star Wars universe without classic Jedi, the only society that the Resistance has any chance of achieving is the middle kind: the centrist, capitalist one. They live in a society where a slave economy still reigns in many places, and presumably/hopefully a new Republic would do away with that, but it is very clear from this movie in particular (but in fact also from Lucas' own prequels, in which it was established that the Jedi-run Republic's society was really just normal current-style bourgeois democracy and capitalism, which is inconsistent with the progressive symbolism of the original trilogy), that everything takes place on a capitalist premise. The biggest army belongs to those with the biggest pocketbooks: Good guys and bad guys equally exist on the premise of a monetary society.Hence, the progressive level of this franchise can penetrate no further than to the level of centrism; it can never cross over into truly progressive (left, anti-capitalist, heroic) territory. It is thoroughly establishmentarianist, just like Disney, and can never be anything else, no matter how much it focuses on the \"little people\"; the slaves and workers and common folk. The story aspires only towards the end of slavery, and the attainment of current-style capitalist democracy (which is not genuine democracy but a heinous means of manipulating the ignorant masses) and is not anti-authoritarian at all.These conventions also identify the franchise as entirely fantasy, now dispensing with any lingering pretentions to being science fiction. I hate that; I preferred looking at Star Wars as science fiction, since science fiction is always and inherently far more progressive than fantasy.Conclusion: Since there is nothing progressive about the movies that follow the original SW trilogy, there is no artistic substance to speak of, either. Nothing to root for if you are a progressive - besides the sheer visual spectacle, that is, which is indeed magnificent.I will emend my initial 2/10 rating of \"The Last Jedi\" to a subtly higher 3/10 because of the visual splendor, and because the movie, after all, gives us much to discuss. But one thing is certain: it truly is a soulless commercial product, intended, in the absolute main, to get bums on seats and keeping them transfixed with empty-calorie bread and circus. Bad, bad movies. But at least they are interesting to discuss - until, of course, the novelty of this, too, wears off.\n",

      "2. The dialogue was so clunky, worse than Leia's dialogue in TFA (and I didn't think any dialogue could be worse than that)\r\n",
      "3. No actor direction. Very evident it was \"visionary\" direction, but not character.\r\n",
      "4. The main plot: Luke throwing lightsaber over his shoulder?! His attitude \"Get off my lawn\"? That works for Hamill being fascetious. It doesn't work for this movie. Rey getting less than 18 hours of instruction? It shows her sleeping twice, but she shows up on Crait at the end. (Continuity issues-you need a calendar for the plot when you write!) The books just being for show and burn? The whole infinity mirror thing? \r\n",
      "5. Finn/Rose subplot-it could have been removed entirely or shortened to making contact with the real MASTER CODEBREAKER and getting off planet fast. MASTER CODEBREAKER should have been Lando. DJ just shouldn't have been. Finn and Rose should have spent more time on the flag ship being chased by stormtroopers, not captured so easily. Cut the whole thing about the horse things and the stable kids (obviously a set up for Rian's upcoming trilogy-which I will not watch).\r\n",
      "6. Poe/Leia subplot-loved Poe's humor, but the mother joke has to go. Mutiny should have been expanded and worked. Leia should have either died in space or piloted the cruiser on the suicide mission. AT-ATs and skimmers-yeah, should have been the speeders from Hoth. Should have been a fully engaged battle.\r\n",
      "7. I knew we were getting Porgs on the island, but those nun-like creatures and the sea cows being harvested for blue milk? Really? Isn't one cute animal enough for the merchandising profits? OK, the crystal critters could stay, too. But the rest just had to go.\r\n",

      "9. Admiral Holdo-artistically, she was strong and a great foil for Poe. It was evident that she and Leia could not been on screen together for a long time-too much wow there. However, even though Laura Dern was perfect in her part, why in the world did they go for another white female? (And I'm a white female, so don't say I'm being racist here.) How many of our strong female characters are white? Could she have not been black or Hispanic? Just scratching my head here.\r\n",
      "10. BB-8 saves the day every single time? Really? tying up the guards playing Sabacc? shooting out gold coins? commandeering an AT-ST? How did he get in there? We were pandered to with all of those scenes.\r\n",
      "11. The anti-white man slant here. It is one thing to include a variety of races and more females, but it should not have been at the expense of writing every white man as incompetent, loony, or weak. It just shouldn't have.\r\n",
      "12. Snoke's death. What a waste of an amazing villain. Give him a backstory. Give us hints in VIII and full-on reveal in IX.\r\n",
      "13. Hologram Luke (I knew immediately when he had the brown beard with Leia it was a projection). Why couldn't he have raised his X-Wing and joined the fight? Why couldn't he have faced down Kylo Ren for real? Even if Ren overcame him because he was old, it would have been a better way. Also, they could have left him injured (instead of Rose), so we all wonder if he will survive long in the next film. This was just the wrong way to do it. (I did like his peaceful death scene, though. Way to go on the full lotus, Hamill.)\r\n",
      "14. The Slowest Space Chase in History. It was a waste of film. Plot holes galore. How about the First Order cripples the cruiser, they escape to Crait (which is an abandoned Imperial base), etc.? Spend time on Crait showing how they think they'll win. Give them enough technology to get an early tiny victory. Cheated on this. So cheated.\r\n",
      "15. When the Flag Ship is hit, I really hated that black-and-white sequence. It was shoving it our faces that Rian Johnson was this visionary photographer. It jerked me out of the movie yet one more time. Stop trying to be so artsy and tell the story! \r\n",
      "That's what made the original trilogy great-George specifically did not make Star Wars like the sci-fi of the 70s that spent long minutes photographing beautiful sets and locations and effects. He made a mistake with the prequels when he thought that we wanted those beautiful sets and locations and effects at the cost of the story. Rian, you made that fatal error, too. I was trying to identify where this film fits in my list of likes. 5, 6, 7, 4, 3, R1, 2, 1, 8\r\n",
      "What's really sad is I thought this was going to the best Star Wars movie ever made with the mysticism back and the dark tones and tons of character development with a compelling plot. I'm crying right now as I realized how we've been cheated and lied to.\r\n",
      "JJ, it's not too late. You can still change this around.\r\n",
      "How to fix this:\r\n",
      "1. Rey has to make mistakes, and those mistakes must hold dire consequences for her. Like Luke ignoring Yoda's warning and losing an arm and finding out the truth about his father when he wasn't ready for it. Like Luke ready to stand for the right at the end of ROJ, even if it meant painful death. \r\n",
      "2. Rey has to be a person of importance. Kylo Ren's explanation does not coincide with the Force vision. Since 5 minutes earlier Snoke says he was manipulating both their minds, make it so that Snoke put this false information in both of those. Rey was waiting for her family to return in TFA. They left. We saw it. I don't care if she's Luke's kid he didn't know he had or Han's kid at this point, but Anakin's lightsaber calling to her proves she is Anakin's granddaughter.\r\n",
      "3. You have to give motivation for Kylo Ren turning entirely evil and focused on destroying Luke Skywalker at the end. His motivation was finding Luke before, but not killing him. Killing started after he killed Snoke. Plagueis survives by the apprentice killing his host body and the spirit of Plagueis possessing the apprentice. That is the key. Don't mess this up.\r\n",
      "4. Recast Leia for at least a few minutes in the beginning of the film. She has to tell Rey who she is or at least give her clues that lead Rey by the end of the film to find out who she is.\r\n",
      "5. There is no way Luke decided to just kill Kylo Ren as a sleeping teenager. There had to be more of a motivation: Kylo threatening the love of Luke's life, or injuring her, or something. That would give proper motivation for Luke to exile himself.\r\n",
      "6. No more Hasbro money pits. Just stick to the story. Leave out the furry creatures. Make Chewbacca ferocious again. A vegan he ain't.\r\n",
      "For IX, I will be looking for spoilers, instead of avoiding them. If it doesn't have what I'm looking for (see the 5 points above), I'm not giving Disney another dime. End of story. You have one more shot in my book to get this right.\n",

      "I've heard some people say that Star Wars The Last Jedi is not about anything. I don't know what movie these people were watching, but what I saw was an emotionally substantial, evocative, intensely meaningful movie.\r\n",
      "The overarching message of The Last Jedi is the notion that the needs of the many outweigh the WANTS of the few. Luke imparts this message to Rey when he reveals that the Force does not belong to the Jedi, but to everyone. Rey tries to convey this message to Kylo Ren as she strives to win him back to the light side. Leia and Holdo teach this lesson to Poe when they attempt to show him that rushing in and being the hero is far less important than protecting the light. And Rose beautifully expresses this sentiment to Finn after she saves his life and urges him to understand that the war against the First Order will be won by saving what they love, not killing what they hate.\r\n",
      "The story is about the importance of collectivism, of embracing and protecting community and rejecting self-centered pride. It's interesting to note that the characters that express these major themes the most are female characters who are attempting to inspire and open the eyes of male characters. It is true that women tend to be more communal and it makes sense that the female characters would be the ones to spread this message of rejecting selfish dreams of glory and accepting the strength and power that comes from togetherness and unity. Such a great and unexpected theme to find in a movie series that is historically about some guy who is the chosen ONE who must save the galaxy.\r\n",
      "In one excellent scene, Leia admonishes Poe for recklessly attacking the First Order dreadnought, an attack that costs many lives. Poe tries to defend himself, saying the people they lost were heroes. Leia responds with \"Dead heroes. No leaders\". Leia gets it. She has seen her share of hotshot heroes and she knows that it is better to raise up leaders who will bring the people together than to glorify heroes who will ultimately fade away.\r\n",
      "This is why Rey is so important. She seems more interested in leading than gaining power or renown for herself. The revelation that Rey's parents were nobody of significance was so essential. It takes us back to the message of A New Hope, to the idea that even a nobody from nowhere can be special. Rey doesn't have to descend from some space-royalty bloodline to matter. Who cares who her parents are or who anybody's parents are. What is important is using one's power to lead with compassion. This is why Rey will be the greatest Jedi; she doesn't have to be a hero or a Princess, she can be a leader who shares the Force rather than keeping it for herself.\r\n",
      "The Last Jedi is brilliant and it is certainly not about nothing. There are so many powerful messages in this story, timely messages. It is about the folly of vanity and hubris. It is about the importance of humility and forgiveness. It is about the idea that anybody can be a leader. It is about the danger of running away from feelings. It is about the destructiveness of greed. It is about the universal significance and power of hope. It is about the strength of women. It even takes a jab or two at organized religion and its tendency to anoint itself the arbiter of all good things. At its heart, it is about putting the needs of the whole galaxy ahead of the needs of the vain and the greedy and the conceited few.\r\n",
      "Who will save the galaxy? Who will bring balance to it all? Probably not a lone man with a sword or gun out for glory. Instead, it will probably be a group of people who believe in balance, in equality, in protecting the greater good.\n",

      "I was for sure a OT fan as a kid and a watcher of the prequels during college and i enjoyed them, even with the lackluster dialogue. So i went with an open mind to watch \"The Last Jedi\", the Force awakens was a solid 8 to me, not the best movie around but JJ Abrams, even with his mistery boxes sure knows how to produce spectacle.\r\n",
      " The Last Jedi was somewhat a mixed bag. First the positives:-It has the most original camera movements in the saga, Rian Johnson is a master at knowing how to direct each shot . Getting a scene into the mood and pushing the chemistry from actors .Carrie Fisher was more prominent here than in 7 and she did a good job, sad she wont be here for the third, we can see that her comeback could be even better in these films.Mark Hamill, even though out of a big picture for a long time was perfect in his older \"Get off my lawn\" Luke, -Snoke was believable as a cg character, sometimes i would even forget that Andy Serkis was there in a mocap suit, so Bravo!-Adam Driver is compelling as an actor, he and Daisy Ridley were well cast and can work with the archetypes that were given to them. -The effects were polished, sound was top notch, and even without many new compositions, John Williams gives us a great \"Member berries\" Best off,mixing themes from previous films, like Yoda*s theme,TIE Fighter attack and some tunes from the prequels. Now for the bad(oh boy):The movie had a weird tone, some scenes blended really dark themes with a Poe Dameron or BB8 gag right next to them, so i was mostly pushed back from more tense moments.Some characters were overly two dimensional, yes its a fantasy movie in space but having characters like snoke being overly \"Im the bad guy, i manipulated you!\" Was too much, Palpatine was a sleazy villain, but remember, he was an idealist, a seducing idealist that kept showing both Luke and Anakin the benefits of the dark side and the failure of the Jedi. The use of Snoke as a throwaway character, yes, as i said, Andy Serkis even with a two dimensional dialogue sold us a character that, if developed could be really something if it would somehow fit in the world of the story, he comes from nowhere( or some uncharted part of the galaxy) he is really old,tall, he seduced kilo and gets off like a wimp. Well, maybe Disney will someday pull of a Dark Maul on him in some obscure book or tv show. The treatment of Luke Skywalker was kinda painful, even though Hamill performance is great, luke is used as a new character, like if the Skywalker we knew was a dead memory, he is now the total opposite of the \"New Hope\" we knew, now he hates the Jedi (but somehow decided to live on a planet filled with Jedi memorabilia), tried to kill his nephew boosting Kylo Ren in the first order (while being the only guy who had faith on his father redemption). His arc is boringly slow for a last minute turn., guess his love for milk is the only characteristic left unchanged. -Mary Leia Poppins, this idea can sound great in paper, and you can see the love in each shot on the scene, but has a final result it feels cringy, also is really Leia acting on her force powers? Was she trained? Is there an Anakin Ghost pushing her towards the safety of the ship (\"Oh Leia, im so sorry for having tortured you, here now i'll save you\"), Because we see her force hands magnetizing back to the ship, yep, its the first option and Leia is an action force user, guys, if you want to give her force trained powers show us, make her say she trained with Luke or something... Luke Skywalker. send off. Im betting this was not a Rian Johnson idea, it feels like a committee deciding to kill the trio by order, Ep7 Han,Ep8 Luke, Ep9 Leia. This only gives the trilogy a very formulaic feel, even in the prequels you felt that the formula was in the chaos of George Lucas \"it rhymes\" and not in a bunch of people deciding tributes and cameos to please every people imaginable. That way you please no one, and im not really interested in the discussion of a Force Projection , the projection itself worked for me, (EU Luke used it in the comics a couple of times for long calls), its the journey of luke towards his demise, you give a rotten egg to the old fans and a grumpy boring old man to newer generations. -Rey and Kylo, the legacy of the force, i have very low interest in these characters, more with Kylo, mostly because of his tortured soul, but i cant see him as the main baddie in 9, he is designed as a emotional wreck, a brat, a vader fan boy, the toy of snoke, we know his frailties, his despair, Vader worked better in Empire (if you skipped the prequels) he had mistery and his low tolerance for failure of his staff was vaguely funny, but it wasn't a in your face joke, the broken man was inside a literal shell. Ben Solo has showed us his soul and heart, even if you would show the man killing hundreds of rabbits (or porgs) i will never see him as a menace to fear. Rey is different, agendas apart she gives more of herself for the cause, we see her train and her will to be a Jedi and save the galaxy, those are positives i guess, but she is so overpowered, such a blank slate of a character (even though Daisy Ridley's and Johnson efforts to give her density), Rey had very few tribulations and got so far that she loses believably as a \"human\" being in my opinion. At least make us identify with her cause, give us her suffering, her ideals, her sorrow, make her want to get rid of this burden called the force (give her some of Lukes motivations), slice her a limb at least (not sure if joking), i've identified more with Lara Croft in the original game than with this avatar of a Goddess.  the only way they could work from now on was to switch Kilo to the light side and Rey to the Dark but Disney would never do this to their main female protagonist. Its a shame, they are great actors but due to a bunch of corporate and social factors they aren't getting pushed to the next level. Sure, Disney might get her pregnant with a skywalker seed, but having this action figure, a model for every girl out there being used to bring skywalker babies to the world would be a risk. Everything is risk it seems. Male, female, black, white, asians, treat them as characters with a good story, there is your true representation. and that takes me to :Poe Dameron, Phasma, DJ , Chewbacca, Finn and Rose, the representation underrepresented, Poe is a perfect pilot with stupid decisions and he is the joker of this film, Phasma is an \"action figure bait\" and a waste just like the previous film, Finn is goofy, clumsy and brave just to face Phasma in her bobba Fettian cameo, Dj is Benicio del Toro with a speech impediment, Rose is competent and Finn's new love interest, brave and cute. But this is another irrelevant component in this movie, their participation on the overall story takes too much time and seemed like secondary quests on an RPG , yes those you leave behind because of so much filler.  Sure there are funny moments with them, they are great actors afterall, Rian knows how to make action set pieces work, but at least make them more involved in reys story and not a fetch quest: Finn and Rose are seeking a hacker and afterwards to release captive animals, Phasma is seeking Finn, Poe is seeking his leadership among a pink haired Laura Dern and Chewie is trying to surpass Han's death among a stray flock of Porgs (Im fine with them). At least in Empire, Han/Leia plot is intertwined with Luke and Vader's Journey, it doesn't feel forced, Luke abandons his training because he feels the suffering of his friends who are escaping Vader, that takes him to cloud city where he is late, Han is lost to the carbonite and he will lose the fight against his father. here Rey abandons her training because she is fixated with Kylo, the group meets at the end, in the chaos of battle they work together to fight the first order, they are all great soldiers, pilots and tactical thinkers, i felt they couldn't die, it was just an action scene where the script pay offs started to show. Rey hovers a boulder barrier while Luke Ex Machina appears to face the nephew in his ultimate form, skywalker is happy because the last Jedi is now Rey.... Sure she trained for a couple of days and now is the carrier of the last Jedi books (the ones she stole). The film isn't mediocre, its just a lost chance to blend the cool ingredients they had in The Force Awakens, Just disappointing and bland. So i dont blame Rian Johnson, i've seen him getting threats on Twitter, he wasn't to blame but the overall committee thinking of modern film making, its just like a sawed off shotgun, if you want to hit multiple targets in the distance it will disperse your shot all over the place with little to no effectiveness ( and im not even a gun person), movies want to be progressive and regressive, for all ages, for all genders, for hardcore fans and newer audiences, for all cultures and ideologies, and so they get bland, diluted in their potential. The directors for future Star Wars movies and the story group should start to focus on telling cool stories, if they want to kill characters do it but first show us their potential and we will sob or cheer. Like George Lucas said, its \"beautifully made\", but i found it lacks soul and real risks. \r\n",

      "Hollywood abused and exploited a storied Star Wars franchise to pathetically attempt to brainwash society with its moronic, crude and blatantly obvious political undertones. Instead of staying true to the Star Wars roots, the creators of this film opportunistically infused this film with ridiculous, condescending and contradictory messages about female empowerment and multiculturalism. I came to watch this film to be entertained. Instead, I was nearly puking on the matriarchial messages that Hollywood has been spewing for the past few years now with other movies such as Rogue One, female Ghostbusters??, Wonder Woman, etc.To give you a few examples - Admiral Holden(?) - Female - is lauded as a hero for sacrificing herself and going down with the ship. On the other hand, Finn and Poe are portrayed as dumb, reckless, douche-bag fools for willing to sacrifice themselves and scolded and slapped(!) (where are the outcries of physical abuse?) by female characters (whom I thought were absolute jokes). Despite Hollywood seeking to be \"progressive\" with its millennial, multi-cultural cast, it continues its racist streak of not casting any Asian men (save for Master Yoda of course). This film was an absolute waste of money and time and I urge you all to not watch this movie because otherwise, you are just throwing more money into the racist, feminizi, hypocritical, decadent and greedy machine known as Hollywood.\n",

      "*SPOILERS*As a bit of a preface, one of the resons that Lucas has had such a lasting impact on so many fans is because he created an alternate reality that had creative properties and themes that helped lead to the creation of a an alternate reality universe that fans could immerse themselves in. This was built up over decades, and love or hate any of the prior films in this series, they kept that alternate reality in place. This movie destroys it.First off the absolutely insane condescension towards women. I don't want my young daughter to ever see this movie, the level of patronizing and superficial treatment is utterly demeaning. Leia will be the one people point to first, exhibiting the powers of one of the most powerful sith lords ever to have lived- while she was a never trained force sensitive? Then she violently assaults a subordinate non force adept for making a call she didn't like- you would be hard pressed to find a more demeaning portrayal of a character. She is in a position of supreme power and resorts to violence against her staunchest ally? What message is that sending? Someone with nigh god level powers beating on a layman. Disgusting.Admiral Holdo is even worse. Trapped in a situation where you are facing overwhelming odds and every person in you command is convinced they are going to die you refuse to tell them your gameplan..... why? Are there truly women who are stupid enough to do something like this? Managing morale is paramount to being a good leader, and Admiral Holdo fails in this aspect more spectacularly then anyone I've seen in any movie ever. What's worse- there were a plethora of modifications she could have taken to greatly increase the odds of survival for her people which she didn't even contemplate. She lost the lives of almost every person under her command unnecessarily due entirely to gross ineptitude. The character Rose, as a story driver was shockingly poor. She came across as a third tier club comic that offered absolutely no emotional weight, wasn't funny, had no chemistry with anyone she interacted with and every moment she was on screen was utterly irrelevant to the plot. This is shamefully terrible story telling, sub par, at best, acting, tonally off and nothing but an anchor around the neck of an already terrible movie. In the final battle scene when all of them are racing full throttle into the enemy line, she drops back as she is told to do while Finn hammers full throttle to try and kamikaze the enemy canon. Somehow- Rose manages to T-Bone him out of the way with utterly no explanation on how she was driving an identical vehicle started off way behind and managed to loop around. This plays out like the director realized at the last minute he had marginalized the women yet again and magically made her have super powers over the laws of physics so she could do something.Now we get to Rey. First off is her parents. We spent 1.75 movies having this built up as a crucial plot point to find out it is...... nothing. You don't do this. If it isn't important, briefly deal with it and move on, you don't spend almost two movies building up to revealing- it never mattered. I see a lot of comments about how much of a Mary Sue Rey is, but let's get real- she did absolutely nothing in this movie that mattered. Every important action that had real consequences was done by a male. It's as if the director is incapable of imagining how a woman could actually matter. It seems like he is uncomfortable with this side of himself, so he makes Rey seem like she is very powerful, but at the end of the day- she isn't good enough to do anything that matters. JJ Abrams at least had Rey as a crucial plot device- this one- nothing.Continuing with the last point in abstract- Only a force sensitive male is allowed to have any impact on the larger story arc. Ren, Snoke and Luke have every pivotal event that actually impacts the outcome revolve exclusively around them. Rey, Leia, Rose, Finn and Holdo are nothing but sidekicks waiting for the force powered men to direct the flow of the story. This is unique in Star Wars lore and a disturbing abandonment of common people making the key difference. Han saving Luke from Vader, Lando rescuing Leia, Chewie and Luke, Lando destroying the Death Star, Amidala ceasing control of Naboo back from the trade federation- it has been a constant theme in Star Wars movies- even with super powered warriors, common people and their actions can decide the outcome. This movie has absolutely none of that. Everything attempted by someone who isn't a male force wielder fails miserably.Supreme Leader Snoke- I will say that I am a *HUGE* Star Wars fan- this one probably would bother casual fans a lot less. Snoke linking Rey and Ben was a force dominate mind ability. Powerful Sith Lords have been doing things along these lines for millennia. This meant that Snoke was inside the heads of both Rey and Ben and was manipulating what they were capable of seeing. Furthermore, all force adepts have a level of precognition- the more powerful they are, the stronger that becomes. Why this explanation- Snoke would have seen what Kylo Ren was planning on doing with the light saber *before* he even had the thought. It is hard to explain just how stupid this was. This would be akin to the Hulk getting killed by a falling marshmallow. They set the story line in a world that has rules- this was such a bad plot point it was grotesquely painful to watch- all for a laugh.Now we get to the humor. Every Star Wars movie had humor in it, normally it was focused on the droids, used sparingly and appropriately. This movie suffered from the humor in rather profound ways. It has been implied and discussed at length that this is a dark movie- watching it felt more like a bad buddy cop/rom com hybrid- but even they will lay down their comedy at certain junctures to create a proper emotional tone to drive home a point. This movie failed profoundly and absolutely to create any sense of true tension or dread. It felt lighter in tone than any Star Wars movie, but a massive margin- Episode I seems downright depressing in tone compared to this. Clearly the director has absolutely no sense for comedy whatsoever, not how to use it, when to use it, or why it should be used. This is a movie where almost all of the good guys die, they are beaten to the point of being non existent, and people who were OK with the movie were in high spirits walking out? I don't know if you can find a better indicator of what was wrong with this movie then that. The director failed on a catastrophic level.\n",

      "We are living in Orwellian times. The critics have been bought and paid for by faceless corporations to sell an agenda to a public looking for entertainment. Nostalgia weaponized to lure the masses to watch subvert anti white propaganda. Hear me out. Spoilers to follow Opening scene Poe declares general Hux to be \"pasty\" faced. A distinct reference to his identity, would this be allowed to be said to a character of color? The Resistance the protagonists are now a diverse group compromised mainly of Poe (Hispanic) Finn (Black) Tico (Asian) and several other minority characters whom die heroically through out he movie. I am glad for that as it is important to show heroes come in all colors and sizes but........The First Order The antagonists is compromised still as being almost exclusively an all white male regiment. Save Captain Phasma who remains completely hidden behind a mask until Finn the black protagonist cracks her helmut just enough to reveal...a single decidedly blue eye peering out that declares to Finn...You'll always be scum before falling to her death into a giant fireball. No symbolism there Disney?? Be careful what you sell people Disney. People are smart enough to understand storytelling is imagery as much as script. On to the film. Brilliant young actors. All of them. Boyega handles humor well. Hamill shines. Driver and Ridley are standouts. The best thing about the movie is the acting. Hands down. The script. Bad. \r\n",
      "The whole heavy handed message in the middle of the movie about war profiteering and abusing animals for entertainment felt out of place and forced and should of been left on the cutting room floor. Too much forced (excuse the pun) humor. To the point it betrayed the essence of beloved characters. Star Wars was so original when it was made it's a shame Disney now feels the need to copy the current super hero trend of excessive comedy in its story. Wayyyy to much humor. Luke tossing his light saber over his shoulder. Come on. Chewbacca takes in his tiny new co pilot friend (shades of groom anyone) guess Disney has to sell those toys. Luke dies- Really?? Is Disney that unhinged that they took the most beloved character and hero to millions and just have him die in some bizarre anti climatic way before the 3rd chapter. Especially knowing that Carrie Fischer passed away untimely and would not be in the 3rd chapter either. This is messaging overtaking good storytelling. Disney wants to distance the story from the structure that was created so successfully to stamp it with their agenda. Sleazy and disappointing to millions of fans.In short too much cultural Marxism, but great acting and great special effects. Too many plot holes. A stylized product with subvert imagery and agenda driven. No soul. And with Luke in it - it should of been ALL SOUL. Not nearly as good as the original trilogy but better than phantom menance. On par with Attack of the clones.A true disservice to the fans that have been loyal since 1977. But i guess we are not the demographic target anymore and must be killed off much like Han, Luke and Leia. Bastards\n",

      "Just to start off - I've never wrote a review before and I don't plan to going forward, but I had to create an account just to write a review at how bad this movie was. I have to admit (and I assume many others had a similar experience), I left the movie actually thinking I it was pretty good. I don't know if it was adrenaline or what, but after some time passed and I had some time to dwell on the movie I came to recognize the many glaring issues with it. For lack of a better way to attack all the issues I decided to make a list. In order of significance:1. Disney SJW liberal feminist agenda/propaganda - \"women are strong leaders and men are hot headed and trigger happy dummies\" Ie: That purple haired female character is the perfect embodiment of this. The overt attempt to make all the female characters ridiculously powerful or strong leaders Ie: Rei with the force, Leia \"Supermaning\" through space, Purple haired gal leader. And on top of all this pretty much every actor in the First Order is a white male! DISNEY - STOP PUTTING YOUR POLITICAL BELIEFS IN YOUR MOVIES - its ridiculous. Slipping in your identity politics is just propaganda BS. Women ARE strong. I love women, but overcompensating and making it so glaringly obvious with this hidden feminist agenda BS actually makes it seem like you actually think they that women are pathetic/weak so you are giving them a leg up!!!!!\r\n",
      "2. Luke's character flaw - he would NEVER have done what he did PERIOD. He would have talked face to face with Ben Solo about the darkness he saw in him first and tried to convert him that way. What happened in this movie is not in line with his character at all and I'm pretty sure everyone that has watched the original trilogy would know this.\r\n",
      "3. Leia supermaning through space - WTF?!?!\r\n",
      "4. Snoke death and no backstory. Yes, the mysterious Snoke who I was looked up countless hours of fan theories Ie: \"Who is Snoke?\" is dead. WITH NO BACKSTORY?!?!?!? WHO IS SNOKE DAMNIT!?? \r\n",
      "5. Captain Phasma death and no backstory\r\n",
      "6. Benicio Del Toro character - just so happens he's a codebreaker, just so happens Finn and Rose get put in the same jail cell, just so happens he can break them out of jail. Why is he in jail in the first place if he can just break out? Makes NO SENSE. Also, no backstory.\r\n",
      "7. Why didn't the Purple haired gal just TELL POE THE PLAN?!?! WHY, WHY, WHY WHY?!?!?!? JUST TELL POE THE FREAKING PLAN!!!\r\n",
      "8. During Rei's training she sees that black hole (the darkness) Luke tells her to resist the darkness. Within 5 minutes she finds black hole and falls through the black hole. I really thought we would learn something cool about Rei Ie: Why she is so strong with the force? - Who are her parents? - NO!! We learn NOTHING! Nothing at all! What a waste of a cool/suspenseful scene.\r\n",
      "9. Luke milking that cow alien thing and drinking the milk - just so random and weird and unnecessaryI could really go on and on and on. My final comments - What do we have to look forward to in the next movie? Seriously. Rei converting Kylo? That's it I guess. I couldn't care less. You've ruined everything. Will not be paying to see the 9th episode when it comes out as I feel you have stolen my money on this one. I HATE THIS MOVIE. Star wars has always been my favorite Universe and it's completely ruined. There is no doubt in my mind that I could have made a better movie then this.\n",

      "So the pros, I liked the special effects, like the Dreadnaught and the imperial Walkers. Now for the bad... George Lucas told a story he didn't try to make social statements. I have no problems with anyone playing a part whether they are woman or man or black or white, but intentionally casting women just to make a social statement has no place in a Star Wars movie. No I'm not some old white male I'm just a regular kid whos tired of this social progressive crap. Rian Johnson said its time for a woman to direct a Star Wars film but yet he's agreed to do an upcoming trilogy of Star Wars films?! I wonder how he would feel if Disney said were going to give the job to a woman just because we think its time to let a woman have a shot instead of giving it to the best qualified director without any regard to race or gender. Sorry but the addressing social issues in the Last Jedi ruined the film for me. Every time they introduced a new female character I rolled my eyes, that along with Luke Skywalker drinking green milk from some random creatures tit and having Smoke killed with only seeing him for a few minutes was a deal breaker for me. George Lucas told a story, developed characters and embraced the Star Wars Universe. It seems like Disney will now pump out Star Wars films every year for the next decade to cash in.\n"
