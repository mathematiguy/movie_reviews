"December 27, 2017","A gorgeous looking and sounding Star Wars movie with bad writing, a tone death use of humor,pointless characters mixed with a few good ideas makes gives you flashbacks to early prequel films",2, Ben w
"December 27, 2017","The fact that this movie received a critic score of 91% confirms my suspicions that these critics are paid off. Star Wars the last Jedi was the worst film I've seen in 2017. Lucas is rolling over in his grave right now. George Lucas isn't dead? Well he is now after seeing his life's work completely ruined.

For starters, the whole Luke Skywalker storyline was entirely contrived and unnecessary. While the previous film builds up an exciting Skywalker re-introduction, his scenes fall short of any sort of excitement. 1.5 hours of the film are dedicated to building a plot that hardly exists. The writing is mediocre at best with random dialogues and ill placed jokes. 

The ending left me with questions that I have no interest in know the answers to.",0, Anthony T
"December 27, 2017","ust watched ""The Last Jedi"". I have to say, I am really indifferent about the movie at this moment. I almost want to lean towards, I don't care anymore about the main saga of Star Wars.

Don't get me wrong, the movie was well directed, looked amazing, and was very entertaining.

I am just not happy with the direction they are taking the story, and decisions made for many of the characters.

I will watch the next movie, and maybe, just maybe, the completion of this story arch will change my mind. However, that is going to be a large order to fulfill as far as I am concerned.",0, Ronald P
"December 27, 2017","As long as you can keep eyes on visuals and FX it's tolerable, but it wasn't for me.

The Last Jedi trying too hard to deconstruct Original Trilogy. There is a clear message ""Past must die"", and this message isn't only to characters, but to audience. 

The goal of this deconstruction is to throw away all previous Star Wars, episodes and Expanded Universe production, to cease comparing and complaining, like ""It was in A New Hope already"", or ""Zahn wrote about it and it was better"". 

While chasing this goal, movie misses in other directions. Abundant plot holes, bad pace and one-dimensional characters made it awful.",1, 
"December 27, 2017","Gaping plot holes, corny jokes and made with practically zero understanding of space. Would be a 2 stars if it hadn't also ruined star wars for me. Probably last one I'll see in a cinema.",0, Ben L
"December 27, 2017",Loved it! One of my favourites.,4, Scott C
"December 27, 2017","This felt like someone pitched a bunch of really cool scenes regardless of whether they matched previous cannon, previously established characters, the previous movie, or even this very same movie. 

It's a disjointed, incoherent story and it's a crying shame that the creators can't respect that while visual oos and ahhs drives up the box office the heart and soul of star wars has always been the story. 

To call the scenes duct taped together is a disservice to the wonders of our shiny grey friend.",2, Wookie S
"December 27, 2017","The Last Jedi is an awesome movie. It is the most visually striking movie I've ever seen, and the character dynamics between Rey, Kylo and Luke are perfect. Rose and Fin have some great interactions too, although it's on top of a terrible filler story. Rey's emotional journey gives us someone who has a lot of challenges but also has the balls to face them, and Luke's conclusion makes us challenge whether we are even meant to understand how movie rules work. Plus, there's two scenes where the movie literally drops the mic, and it deserved it.",4, Bheema B
"December 27, 2017","Damnit. I wanted to like it, but this has become a proud franchise sacrificed to naked political signalling. Star Wars is now dead.",0, Kevin D
"December 27, 2017","Wonderful to see strong, smart, POWERFUL WOMEN in charge of lower males, and lead roles filled by African-Americans instead of whites!

I've never been a star war fan or even liked it, but am definitely excited with the direction DISNEY is going by deconstructing the sexist and racist infrastructure white men have built and propagate to systematically oppress women and African-Americans! Our new CORRECTED WORLD destroys these predators and scraps their outdated, defective ways. They are only able to pathetically watch and cry-cry-cry! It is so funny to watch them breakdown and grovel in their own filthy, sexist, and racist cesspool! Kathleen Kennedy will hopefully run for PRESIDENT in 2020!!

We are POWERFUL! We disrespect and EMASCULATE the ""unenlightened,"" and destroy everything they love and cherish... it is SOOOOO hilarious... LOL!!!

If you want LOVE, tolerance and inclusion, this is the movie for you! However, if you are the typical sexist, racist white male, you are in for a RUDE awakening!! We will NOT BE SILENCED!!

This fantastic movie showcases the long, painful journey of all OPPRESSED VICTIMS toward love, tolerance -- and complete annihilation of OUR vile, disgusting OPPRESSORS!! 

Disney is definitely on the ""RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY"" with this latest STAR WARS release!!!",5, Tynisha J
"December 27, 2017","Read the other negative reviews. No, these are not from bots or rabid purists or foreign saboteurs... this is a bad movie, just garbage whether SW is in the title or not.

I'm no super dork or fan boy- I loved the characters of original Star Wars movies because they embodied the classical Campbellian 'Hero's Journey'. It wasn't all about the special effects or CGI, it was THE STORY. The characters! TLJ fails utterly in that regard.

If you were a fan of and alive to see the original movies (SW,ESB,RoTJ) in the theater, this movie made it very clear that you are not the audience these new Star Wars movies are made for any longer. If you expected an intelligent, engaging, fun, well-rounded story or anything enticing and satisfying that the trailers seemed to promise, you left sadly disappointed.

I was with a theater half-full of all kinds of families/people (tweens, teens, Millennials, Gen Xers, boomers) for a Monday afternoon showing, and I can tell you that once the end credits finally rolled, it was dead silent. No cheers. No applause. I'd never experienced that at the end of a Star Wars movie before. 

Perhaps that is because no one could believe that what we just sat through was a Star Wars movie... or what a plodding, sophomoric, dumpster fire of canon-mocking, beloved character destroying, forced-down-your-throat trendy social justice warrior / identity politics messaging that Disney had fooled us all into shelling out our hard earned money for. 

All men were deliberately portrayed as cowards, exploiters, opportunists, mutineers, First Order villains or otherwise needed to be corrected/controlled by a woman. Finn is a moronic loser. Poe needed to be slapped. Hux is a dim stooge. Snoke is turned into an unimportant, no-backstory, cartoonish sliced salami. 

Even Jedi Master Luke Skywalker... son of Darth Vader, trained by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, is beaten by a nobody girl-child begot of planet Jakku junkie parents with about only five minutes experience with The Force and Jedi zero training. She beats Luke Skywalker with his own old light saber. Because he's now just a broken, failed, self-hating Caucasian patriarchal representation. Yeah- SURE! The greatest iconic protagonist movie character in generations is an now old white guy, therefore he must be utterly humiliated and turned into a pathetic, selfish coward that wanted to kill his sister's only child and can now only hate himself and suck space walrus teat while waiting to die. And pyromaniac ghost Yoda thinks that just fine, btw. 

Oh and everyone is a Jedi now! No years of hard work, no self discipline, no master/pupil relationship needed! Nope, everyone is a super special Force snowflake! This is Safe Space tantrum generation Star Wars- if you want it, you should have it RIGHT NOW- not work for anything or learn/listen to your elders... nope, you don't have to learn history or bother to improve at anything. You have all the answers without any of the practical experience or comprehension/application of any lessons! Everyone gets a Jedi participation trophy! 

Oh, and you can use the Force angry- there's no Dark side. It's all just inside everyone to do whatever they want, whenever they want because there is no morality... because the past doesn't matter! That is, unless you're a man... in that case, you're a problem, and definitely need to be smacked, demoted or humiliated. Because... The Patriarchy.

F U Rian. F U Kathleen. Where were you preachy social justice crusaders when Harvey and so many others were running wild!?! How dare you myopic hypocrites lecture anyone on anything. 

And a truly big F U to everyone that hired and enabled that delusionally self-involved, 3rd wave feminist coven of ""progressive script writers who helped modernize SW""... Clearly passing 'Screenwriting 101' was not a criteria to join in that sad endeavor. They were fully empowered by Disney to ruin the entire Star Wars universe/brand by inflicting 2.5 hours of Gender Studies gibberish and their own unresolved daddy / relationship issues on audiences that thought they paid to see the teed-up Skywalker / Jedi storylines carried forward from a pretty good 'The Force Awakens'.

You know who were strong female characters in the original and prequel SW universe? Leia! Padmi! Anakin's mother! Mon Motha! These were strong women because they were competent, moral, and rounded out characters in a strong, well written story! Those women didn't need pink hair and a Women's Studies post-doc in Passive Aggression towards any man to ram home some halfwit, current political talking point with no plot value. They were too busy being characters that mattered in a story that made sense.

Seriously... F U to anyone that had a hand in this movie save for Mark Hamill. He died at least two movies too early and in a way that now ruins watching the original trilogy. 

The Last Jedi is the last Star Wars movie made by Disney I will ever see in the theater. I sure as hell won't buy this on DVD or watch it again. Count on that.

Just imagine what utter dreck the Han Solo spin-off will be... Opie's reshoots won't be able to save it... Perhaps Han will be gender fluid, pan-sexual, be a champion for illegal 'aliens', lead galactic White Male Privilege training classes, and star in an elaborate drag queen dance number... none of which would not surprise me in the least after watching TLJ.

SW is dead.",0, Corey B
"December 27, 2017","I don't review movies often, but this Star Wars is one of them. The movie is a complete disappointment if you expect any type of revelation as portrayed in the trailer. 

The action sequences are OK, the opener if given a little thought is just stupid. Why would you bomb something in space? 

Any type of answer to questions fans may have are teased at then pulled away. 

It appears that the writers and director were more in love with the Millennium Falcon than any other character in the movie.

The few positives are that they address how Kylo Ren was beaten by Rye, and how Luke being isolated does not solve any problems in the Force Awakens. 

Otherwise, if you ever wondered what the Empire Strikes Back would look like with out all of the good stuff in it, your question will be answered.

The critic consensus is definitely wrong here.",3, Marc R
"December 27, 2017","A complete disservice to the franchise. I don't know what critics are trying to pull, but this movie was garbage. A pinnacle of human garbage. 

Some may argue that its just a movie and to take it at face value; that's fine. However, movies are supposed to entertain us and this installment does anything but. I really wanted to like TLJ, but I cannot. If I could rate any lower, I would. 0/5.",0, Chachi R
"December 27, 2017",The worst films I've ever seen. When you write trilogy you should tie in the stories. This was the Star War to end all the Star Wars and this trilogy is dead. There's nothing to hope for from this garbage of movie. It single handedly ruins the whole saga and brings the original main heroes just to die for nothing. I wish I'd never seen this movie. Filled with cheap trademark marvel/disney jokes...,1, Jukka K

"December 27, 2017","This pile of rancid garbage is the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen. This movie is so bad that I take back everything negative I said about the prequels. I am convinced Rian Johnson's only research was the Star Wars Christmas Special before calling it good enough and embarking on his quest to kill Star Wars forever. Why else would he systematically throw out 40 years of Star Wars history in favor of creating ""Star Wars the Teen Space Musical"". We are now supposed to be believe that none of the rules matter, anyone can do anything, and randomly jumping around a nonsensical plot about new characters we don't care about is the best way to continue the franchise. I am so disgusted I will not be seeing episode IX. Not even JJ Abrams can fix this kind of damage.",0, Martin L
"December 27, 2017",I watched too much youtubers and unfortunatelly I agree with most of the revolting ones. Had lots of good things to do and they ruin it.,2, Rodrigo T
"December 27, 2017","Some good action parts, the rest feels like the corporate people have some agendas, and they are not easy to fit seamless with the rest of the saga. Won't be seeing this one a second time, that's for sure.",2, 
"December 27, 2017","Awful Story telling with no respect for the source material. Rian Johnson didn't know what do with the characters and doesn't know how to tell a story. Finn and Rose could be deleted from the movie and wouldn't be missed. Every time Johnson got stuck, he just had the characters use the force. Most of the time, this was with no basis in how the Force was used in earlier movies. Luke goes out with a fizzle. If you loved he franchise you will be disappointed.",1, Darren B

"December 27, 2017","This film isn't Star Wars, it's a corporate rehash of the original films and an absolute disgrace to film making and originality in general. Utterly atrocious mercantile junk, with no soul or inspiration. Again, this is not Star Wars.",0, Doug B

"December 27, 2017","There are moments of greatness in an overwhelmingly poorly written farce of a Star Wars movie. 

 The main problem, besides the sloppy writing, is the enormous leaps in logic the director expects the audience to make. 

 I'm not saying my expectations are dampening my experience, but when you hype all these plot points and characters up for 2 years and don't deliver people are going to be upset.",1, Matt C
"December 27, 2017","Not bad but it`s the worst Star Wars movie so far, the story does not respect the base and anything. Luke is a JEDI but here looks like a real looser, I just don´t understand and this just one fact, there are a lot more.",3, 
"December 27, 2017","Terrible!! Makes the prequels look like Oscar contenders. I've no interest in watching Episode 9 now. Where does the story go from here? No mystery, intrigue or interesting characters to care about. 

Rose & Fin's love story, hell no!

What a shame...",0, 
"December 27, 2017","A more appropriate title for this movie would have been The Last Star Wars Movie I Will Ever Be Interested In Seeing. Although visually beautiful & solidly acted, the story basically ends anything about SW that has kept most lifelong fans excited. What is there to look forward to now? The further adventures of Poe, Rey & Finn? Not interested. I understand what Disney is trying to do & why, but all I can say is I have zero excitement or curiosity of what will happen next in the SW universe, and this is from someone who has loved SW my entire life & thoroughly enjoyed TFA & Rouge One. And the saddest part is, it's unfixable. TLJ completely lacks whatever that intangible quality is that makes SW feel like SW. There is literally nothing they can do at this point to redeem the franchise. I will miss looking forward to new SW films but at this point, they are no longer making these movies for me. I imagine the writer//director is the kind of person who enjoys getting reactions out of people, and I hope he's happy with himself. By far the biggest disappointment of the year.",1, Brian M
"December 27, 2017","Great movie gone bad... Amazing effects, some surprising twist but at the end just a bad movie especialy if you are a Star War Fan.",2, Pablo T
"December 27, 2017","First time I had to see a Star Wars movie twice to come down to this review. And so after 2 weeks, here's my conclusion.(Star Wars fans scroll right to the bottom please)..

The Force Awakens left me excited and hungry for what happens next. 

The Last Jedi arrived and instead of delivering the goods, it tried to sway me away with lackluster unwanted excuses.

The Last Jedi is basically a sequel engineered for a new generation of Star Wars fans. Its blended with subliminal messages, the darker and more brooding undertone and even a bit of that Marvel humor formula. It has it's shining moments in terms of music and cinematography, as well as the development of certain characters. 

Unfortunately in it's attempt to deviate from the space opera charm of Star Wars, many of the outcomes are uneven. Most of the mysteries and doubts established in The Force Awakens are just waived away. Standing beside the pantheon of the other movies, it sticks out like a (slightly) sore thumb. 

It is saved by the brilliant performances and presence of the legacy characters...and the devout loyalty of Star Wars fans.

"December 27, 2017","This movie has a basic problem: the lack of any dramatic moment! We have (mostly) action, some dialogue, some (a few) reflection moments (the one with Yoda being very good) but except for this last one there's no sense of drama in any of them: mostly because of misconcepted humour, the rest because of bad decision in building scenes by the director, bad dialogues, or inconsistent secondary characters. 

For the story, Luke becoming an hermit lost in the sadness of bygone days due to something he saw in Kylo was a poor decision, not coherent with the popular conception of the jedi as true warrior of Fait (the Force!) but also Leia plays a bad part with this newfound pacifism of her. But no character has a good part at all, in the end.",0, Fabrizio P
"December 27, 2017","A movie that discards not only the plot elements of it's lackluster prequel but the characterization of personas built up over the entire course of the franchise, The Last Jedi proudly and unapologetically places it's irreverence for its source material on a pedestal so much so it even features as the subtext of the film.

The logical rules for how key technologies in the Star Wars universe are abandoned in order to facilitate empty spectacle without substance. None of the newly introduced characters earn the gravity of the emotions they seem to want from the audience and the narrative relies upon a series of contrivances to plod along.

The harder one thinks about the plot the more frustrating it becomes as it seems that Rian Johnson seems to think that setting expectations only to foil them in itself constitutes some form of quality. Sadly, much in the same way as receiving fecal matter directly to one's face, surprising though it may be it is most certainly neither pleasant and objectively not good.

The Last Jedi is a film that wants to be funny and charismatic at the expense of building the seriousness of tone required to give the plot any weight. When the film does begin to pretend the stakes are high it is ironic that the key characters decide to not care and instead prioritise their interpersonal relationships which again, seem completely un-earned.

Were this any normal film it would be considered a bland spectacle but the fact that this is a Star Wars film makes it saddening.",0, 
"December 27, 2017","""This isn't going to go how you think"" is a great summation with this movie. If you are fine with that, then you will greatly enjoy this movie.

If you are super invested in fan theories? Well. You maybe need to write some fanfic instead.",5, Courtney S
"December 27, 2017","I have to say that I was very disappointed with episode 8. IT failed to deliver, I mean killing of Luke was not cool move. The new film series was supposed focus on the Skywalker family.. I am not surprised that many fans want it dropped from the franchise and remade.",1, 
"December 27, 2017","Just watched it for the second time... and it does not get better the more you see it. The plot holes become obvious, the lack of character development is frustrating... I feel like I've been played. If this is supposed to set the bar for Star Wars films going forward, we can expect more missed opportunities with a migraines worth of needless characters and content - we get it Disney, 'the cute small thing with big eyes that make you go awwww will make great toys!' /s.",0, Brandon R

"December 27, 2017","First: I'm not a bot, I'm not a 40 year old and I'm not one of these anti-SJW rant people.

What I liked:

Rey and Kylo: Not bad, I liked better Rey in the previous one and I'm not really worried about how OP she is. For me it's fine, I mean, why not? Anakin was also OP. Kylo was just great, loved Adam Driver's performance.

Battles and action were pretty good, specially when Kylo is involved.

The effects were pretty good.

What I didn't liked:

- No cliffhanger at the end of the movie. It felt so dull...

- Finn started great in this movie... after that they found another love interest for him and sent both to a stupid mission full of cringey CGI characters, pointless plots and Benicio del Toro acting like he's doing a cameo instead of a character. So dissappointing.

- Why you kill Laura Dern after 20 minutes? She would've been a gret replacement for Leia as one of the leaders... sad. You're great Laura, too bad you won't be in Star Wars anymore.

- Spaceballs humour felt out of place. Sorry... 

- Why you keep humiliating Hux like this? He's a boring buffoon now.

- Why is Luke's island so crowded with random creatures? It was reallly necessary? It feels a little bit too random.

- Phasma hyped everyone before ep VIIwas out. After the movie we felt she was coming back even more badass... She got killed again or whatever. And it feels like she's not even in the First Order

- Poe is OK

- SuperLeia Poppins. Weird. Didn't like it.

Sorry about my english and thank you for reading me. And again I'M NOT A BOT, I'M A 32YO MAN.",2, Chimney S
"December 27, 2017","Fantastic, but i have a few questions aboute Snoke, what are you doing? it's the most powerfull forceuseer and you just kill him, i hope Kylo Ren killed the illusion of Snoke created by the Force.

"December 27, 2017","Thoroughly disappointed that there has been more thought on how to turn star wars into a feminist diatribe than to come up with a better storyline. I have 3 daughters and two boys. My daughters will play the role of Rey in their games for maybe a day and then move on. My boys however decided last night that the only suitable role for them was Kylo Wren. Nice work star wars, for the first time in history you've encouraged boys to want to be the bad guys. The two positive male role models in the film were made to look pathetic. I'm not opposed to mixing it up and having some female Jedi and leadership, but you went way too far. You need a strong male Jedi to get our attention back. I'm done with supporting star wars in Theaters, they went too far. Hope the feminists are happy.",1, Mark B

"December 27, 2017",The movie itself is a good sci-fi movie. But the plot twist and disgrace to the previous star wars movie and iconic character is unacceptable.

"December 27, 2017",I've never felt like reviewing a film before but I'm just so shocked by the silly ratings this film is getting i feel i have to because i loved it. The acting was great almost without exception - I thought Adam Driver was a stand out - from a bit of a weak character in TFA to a real screen presence in this one. And to me it was a treat to see Mark Hamill/Luke again as the jaded last Jedi. Visually the movie was astonishing and beautiful to watch. The action was thrilling and the comedy delivered some real belly laughs. Sure there were some illogical parts to the plot but how realistic is any Star Wars movie? The story swept along with such verve and panache it more than made up for any questionable plot devices. Overall i loved this movie.,4, Andrew K
"December 27, 2017","I don't think I can speak highly enough about The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson's passionate tribute to the Star Wars saga. This movie is so intelligent, thoughtful, self-aware, books can be written about it, but I'm going to keep it short. I can easily understand why the movie has been so divisive, especially if you consider two years filled with speculations, theories and growing expectations. Some fans expected to find these fulfilled within the story and that's where all the fuss is coming from. After all, one of the themes of the movie is the disillusion of facing your idols, when the idea you constructed of them slowly fades to reveal flawed, ordinary human beings. If we stay inside this metaphor, the entire Star Wars franchise is the idol, and we must come to terms with its changes and innovations. We're just discovering new rules, not breaking the old ones. 

The dense weave of references and parallels with the prequels and the original trilogy are abundant but not redundant, closely reminiscent of the epithets and the other formulaic expressions used in ancient epic poems, in a way that cements Star Wars structure as one of an epic tale in space, that also draw fully from archetypal themes and motifs, mostly derived from Jungian psychology, such as the dynamic between Anima and Animus and the importance of the Shadow, or from eastern imagery (see the Yin and Yang, showed both on a visual and on a narrative level). The intentional and conscious symbolism used adds to the reasons that make it a good and powerful narrative. You must dig down and look under the surface to find out how deep and meaningful and rich the story really is, at how many levels it can speak to you. Everything is covered by almost two hours and a half of movie: universal themes such as regret, guilt, loneliness, abandonment, abuse, manipulation, growth, love, failure, masculinity and femininity, sexuality, the relationship between master and apprentice, past and future, light and dark, the seek for identity and belonging, they all find a place in the movie. And the answers the movie gives to the questions the different characters pose throughout the story, rather than obeying to a black and white morality, are not that predictable and they brought us towards grey, which is also the color the heroine choose for her outfit when she is finally beginning to accept the hard truth about her past, realizing that that's not where her worth comes from. Everything is exquisitely nuanced, not a single detail is left meaningless - and that's a lot for a movie that overflows with details. Even the infamous scene where Kylo Ren shows us how shredded he is, is there with the purpose of serving the narrative: it shows us, through Rey's eyes ( and the perfect correspondence between Rey's eyes and the audience's eyes within the movie is remarkable), how human he is, enlightening at the same time the dynamic of their relationship ( they are clearly attracted to each other) and freeing him for a brief moment from his gravity and the aura of tragic Greek hero in favor of a lighter atmosphere (in preparation of a bigger turn for the next episode? The long-awaited redemption maybe? Who knows!). Rian Johnson can toss a wink to the female audience but, to quote our beloved Luke Skywalker, ""it's so much bigger"". The director cleverly drew from ""the heroine's journey"", giving us a story told from the female perspective (for the ones who can recognize the symbols scattered throughout the movie), visually stunning (one word: Crait.) and convincing story-wise.

If The Force Awakens represents the childhood of our heroes, The Last Jedi is about adolescence and its challenges which must be overcome and the director explores these difficulties and the turmoil focusing all his energies on characters development, succeeding in giving the old heroes a good and meaningful departure to make room for the new ones, but without forgetting that they are the roots from which they grow. Luke, despite initially rejecting his last ""call to adventure"", eventually reveals himself as the same merciful boy who tossed his saber and decided not to fight his father, allowing his nephew to vent his anger in a harmless way that protects the light still left in him and acknowledging his crying need for apologies. Finn goes from selfish and reluctant renegade stormtrooper to heroic selfless warrior, willing to sacrifice himself for a greater cause. He is involved in one of the snazziest sequences, set in the opulent casino city of Canto Bight, a true gem inside the movie which totally immerses us in a new piece of the galaxy, after the Mos Eisley Cantina and Maz's castle scenes. Poe, at the beginning reckless and insubordinate, abandons the Spartan ideal of the beautiful and heroic death and gradually learns to see the big picture. They all seem to fail in what they intended to do but the ones who think the twists and turns are purposeless for this reason, are totally missing the point. Failure is the greatest source of wisdom and growth and that is also true for our protagonists, whose crackling chemistry has reached new heights in this movie, thanks to the beautifully subtle portrayal of the two actors: Kylo Ren and Rey.

She's so naive, inquisitive, forgiving, strong but also fragile, impulsive - that is maybe her biggest flaw - but willing to double-check her most rushed decisions. They managed to create a beautiful, complex and multidimensional female character, whose strength is not diminished by her vulnerability and who, as her male counterpart, Kylo Ren, a response to the stifling image of toxic masculinity, is allowed to cry and show emotions and can simultaneously kick asses and let go herself to the tenderness of a blooming love. And it feels so real. Her power lies in her determination, in the eagerness to discover, try and learn, in questioning the reality that surrounds her, in her stubbornness, bravery, openness. And Daisy Ridley displays all of this brilliantly. Despite being apparently her opposite, he is flawed, broken, sad, unsure and vulnerable in the same way. There is innocence and wonder in him too, something the people around him are trying to repress. He's young as her, even if, like her but in a different way, he was forced to grew up too fast. He's been traumatized and brainwashed and struggles to recover from his internal wounds. Feeling betrayed by his own blood he was an easy prey for Snoke, who manipulated him for years. He's starved of affection and latch onto her, with whom he shares an intense loneliness and abandonment issues. They connect with each other on a deeper level, forming an unbreakable bond in the Force that allows them to understand one another profoundly, becoming protective and attached. The mirror scene in the cave couldn't have been more blatant in showing how they recognize themselves in each other and how their destinies are intertwined. Kylo Ren, in his brutal honesty, is the one that's really trying to help her, the one who pushes her figuring out who she really is, how important she is despite coming from nowhere, how much she can achieve. He is more of an antihero than a villain, with Byronic traits and Adam Driver's performance is astonishing in his use of every facial muscle to depict his character's emotions. At the end they are at odds again and they both have made mistakes, but is natural for the middle chapter of a story to reach its lowest point. If the ultimate goal of this new trilogy is the balance, their dynamic is where we have to look for. Defeating Snoke has set an even harder task for the former Ben Solo, that is face his greatest enemy: himself. And even if you need help from the others, the healing has to start from yourself. Rey's rejection was necessary for him in order to realize that. 

I'd like to end with the simple words of the newcomer, Rose Tico, which is by far the greatest and most powerful message of the movie: ""That's how we're gonna win, not fighting what we hate, but saving what we love.""",5, Elisabetta M

"December 26, 2017","A return to what made A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back great - emotionally driven, imaginative and visually stunning stories about space wizards and space nazis. Filled with lessons about war profiteering, failure, religion, love, and hope, and a breath of fresh air after decades of mediocre-to-bad entries in the series. It felt its length toward the end, but the emotional conflict between Rey, Ren and Luke and the fun side-plot of Finn and Rose (not to mention an excellent traitorous character portrayed by Benicio Del Toro) had me interested through every twist and turn!",4, R L
