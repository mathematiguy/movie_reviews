"December 24, 2017","When I heard Disney had purchased Star Wars some years ago, my heart sank. I knew they would trash it. They have exceeded my expectations with this latest steaming pile of cinematic diarrhea. I did not think The Force Awakens was a good film, but hoped that maybe, just maybe, it was just a stumbling before Disney did the series justice. The Last Jedi proves they have no respect (or understanding) for Star Wars and will keep cranking out these dreadful sequels until idiot fanboys/girls stop paying, which by the looks of many of these misguided reviews, will be never. I will never watch another Star Wars film again. Just wish I had adopted this stance prior to sitting through this horrendous farce. 

This movie is so bad, it makes the Prequels look good.",0.5, Hals R

There are, truly, horrible and heartbreaking things in this world to, justifiably, hate; this movie is not one of them.",4, Ian A
"December 24, 2017","If you need to keep checking your watch, the movie sucked. Bitterly disappointing and poorly written.",1, M M
"December 24, 2017","Just hated it. Wanted this movie to make some sense of the very big problems in The Force Awakens. Nope, just throws them away unexplained. Then throws away the main character of the series. Then redefines much of the lore of the series. If they wanted a new saga that would have been great, but don't hijack an existing series and then send a big FU to the fans and the point of the series. Even the new parts of the series don't agree on the direction. I have no interest in the third movie now, and Disney has lost me for the rest of what they have planned.",0.5, James N
"December 24, 2017","TLJ presents a riveting follow-up to TFA. It's fun. It's funny. You witness the fledgling resistance fight back against the FO. It packs quite a punch.

Rey's scenes with Luke are creepy at times, pointless at others. Her scenes with Kylo really were more entertaining. Finn's side-story with Rose provided some relief from the action, gave her backstory, and good explanation for how the FO came about.

The conclusion was a little confusing, but contained some epic scenes. Overall it's best to see TFA and TLJ not as much separate stories. Since one follows right after the other, it gives the impression of a continuation. Episode IX is set up well by TLJ. It's got flaws, but the characters are now better-established and interesting.",4.5, Henry K
"December 24, 2017","This movie sticks with you but for the wrong reasons. It lingers with you and eats away at you. The plot holes, the humor, the giant dump they took on Luke Skywalker. I woke up the next day thinking I had a bad dream where they made the most bizarre and frustrating Star Wars film to date. But it was no dream. When the Last Jedi ends, if feels like the sequel trilogy is going absolutely no where fast. JJ has his work cut out for him with IX, and hopefully Disney learns their lesson after choosing some mediocre director to take complete control, while throwing every SJW trope into the mix as well. I needed to take a bath after sitting through this 2 and a half hour garbage fire. How does Rian Johnson sleep at night knowing he turned Luke Skywalker into a cowardly kook of a character? Watching Disney take over Star Wars has been like watching a slow motion plane crash into one of the most beloved franchises of all time and completely destroying it. Absolutely bizarre and sad. Rest in Peace Star Wars",0.5, Pierre B
"December 24, 2017","This film was a film that didn't have to be made. Simply put this film's plot line could have started and ended in roughly 45 minutes. It dragged for way too long and at the end we didn't get any of the answers we were all asking. Nothing got resolved, no wrap up of previous plots, no story progression, and nothing to kept me wanting to watch the next film. This movie felt like part 2 of 5 and not part 2 of 3. It felt like another Harry Potter film in the mix of the 20 they have.",2.5, Alfredo L

"December 24, 2017","Difficult to know where to start with this mess.

As someone approaching the 40th anniversary of their first viewing of Star Wars this film has disappointed me like no other.

I won't list all the faults in this hot mess, as that has been expertly dune by many many other reviewers.

What does Tick me off that every positive review berate those that dislike it as being stuck in the past etc. 

I don't need some millennial snow flake to tell me what to like, and that this bold direction of Johnson's is fresh and unexpected blah blah.

Sorry it is simply poorly written trash, please explanation to me what this 'new direction' is? All I see is a ridiculous, over long pile of nonsense with enough plot holes to gag a wookiee

This is a trilogy, it isn't 'clever' writing to just ignore all the plot points from TFA, it's rank bad movie making.

The humour is just cringe worthy and not funny at all in the most part.

Rian Johnson has basically just given a FU to Star Wars fans and left absolute nothing for JJ to when in for episode 9 that I now have zero interest in.

If the box office drop off continues as reported this may not make the giant profit that Disney expect, that is the only way Johnson will have the next trilogy stripped from him, he should be allowed nowhere near it, not that Disney care about anything but money anyway.",1.5, Darren S
"December 24, 2017","A post modernist take on Star Wars, which makes Rey the equivalent of a toilet bowl in an art museum. Now we know what a feminist take on Star Wars is like, apparently its like Transformers, but that wouldn't be fair, the robots have more character than the souless husks of ""identity"" politics we see on screen here. They even brought in a pink hair for good measure, because woman strong! 

So congrats, nothing in the Star Wars universe is coherent anymore, now relativistic kill vehicles are a thing, who knew, now every Death Star has become redundant, why build anything when you can just kamikaze everything at light speed. 

At this point the rebels #resist are little more than incompetent terrorists led by women, if the goal of these movies was to get me to root for the Empire, congrats, job done. I can only wish the Empire would win and put this shambling corpse of a franchise out of its misery.

Its not so much that the sacred was destroyed, as some people like to mischaracterize fanboy reactions, its that they took something good, something with potential, and they spat all over it with their progressive politics, throwing away things they did not understand had value because their ideology blinds them to human reality, even natural human interaction evades the progressives grasp now. These are people who believe everyone is the same, yet different, yet interchangeable, their incoherent world view and ignorance of tradition and history yields cultural destruction like this. The modern Mao's red guard are the Kathleen Kennedy and #imwithher types, and you are seeing now why they cannot be trusted with power.",0.5, Churbology J

"December 24, 2017","The good news, it's better than it's predecessor The Force Awakens. The bad news, it starts shiny but it's luster fades decidedly quickly. Rey again is a Mary Sue. Luke is a shade of his former self and while Mark's acting was a saving grace, the story did no Justice to what could have been. Fin, still a completely pointless character, goes on entirely needless adventure . And let's not forget, apparently when the force awakens, basic physics also ceased to work.",3, Donald C
"December 24, 2017",Great story. Something different than the standard SW story in some ways. I appreciate the way they humanized Luke and explore how debilitating grief and despair can be. I also like how this one took the battle a bit beyond simple good vs evil.,5, Brian W

"December 24, 2017","solid 2 stars. It was entertaining to watch but it was riddled with SJW nonsense. This was especially apparent when they go to the gambling planet and the rich are all portrayed as bad guys and you could just tell the movie was advocating for socialism.

then we see some brand new concepts that we have never seen before and will likely never see again. They were just convenient to the plot. rather than have a clever twist to the plot we are just shit on with powers that we have never seen before....",2, Defender o

"December 24, 2017","The Last Jedi Director and writer Rian Johnson definitely took some risks with the middle chapter of the Star Wars Sequel trilogy. Upon first viewing - I had a somewhat mixed reaction. Upon 2nd viewing, my definite response - The Movie is awesome! Great Performances pretty much across the board. More humor than expected, most of which lands well. One VERY poignant scene which I won't spoil. Looking forward to Solo, and Episode 9!",4, Aaron B
"December 24, 2017",What a major disappointment... It shows how big of a disconnect fans/movie goers and critics have.

"December 24, 2017","If you skip this you wont' miss much. The story has plot holes that you can drive a star destroyer through, much is unexplained and leaves the viewer guessing what in the world just happened, and large sections of the plot have no outcome on the final story. The main death in the movie has no apparent reason or explanation why. Some surprises. Some porg bbq. I left the movie not in amazement at the light saber battles or space battle like in past star wars movies, but more of what just happened. I really want to like it because well it's Star Wars, but this was more like a 2 hour commercial for the next movie than something good in it's own right. I have to say I will not be going to see it again in the theater.",0, Tim S
"December 24, 2017","Did not answer or address any story line arcs from Force Awakens. Rian Johnson's went into the creation of this movie with a Troll mentality and total disrespect to original trilogy. Spend 4 billion, I'm going to do what I damn well please. Hey Disney, how many of us fans can you afford to alienate before it cost you. If this is the direction your going my grandchildren will not be brought into ""your"" corrupted cannon. Thank you for destroying my heroes Luke, Leia, and Han. Going to pass on your under developed pussy, politically correct Millennials. Hope you can work global warming into episode 9 to keep them on board. Pass on this movie if you haven't seen it.",0, Tracy S
"December 24, 2017","Rian Johnson took some risks, which was a refreshing move for a massive blockbuster like Star Wars.

I've been reading lots of reviews and I have come across at least 3 where people said it wasn't that great but gave it five stars to balance things out. Seriously people, what Fuck is that!

"December 24, 2017","1 / 10 for me after 2nd viewing. Much worse than first viewing. First time I saw it I was relieved it was not a verbatim copycat like TFA. I loved the play on myths and legends and subverting audience expectations. It seemed clever, fresh. 

Then I just saw it second time an last night. Now I think it is Rubbish. Cardboard characters, inchaote plot, lazy scriptwriting. And was boring to boot. I left the cinema 1 hour in and played with my phone and got a drink and almost didn't feel like coming back. Never happened before with ANY star wars. 

Have little interest in what happens to the new characters - they often do random things anyway and are not developed. No consistency, no proper motivation, not persuasive. And furthermore the hammy humour was often worse than the prequels. 

And Leia Space walking? Luke chucking his saber away right away after being so earnest in TFA. Omniscient' Snoke's laughable demise? A lot of WTF moments that don't fully hit you the first time fully, strike you as terrible the second time. For me at least. 

The entire film felt like a cartoon like Dragonball or Akira with zany and ever expanding force powers that blow buildings apart. Not star wars in tone..I'm no traditionalist,but consistency is important or you lose the cinematic illusion. 

Only good moments for me - the touching Yoda scene and Artoo and luke hologram scene which moved me the first time (but had little impact the second time). Everything else I can forget. Hugely disappointing.

"December 24, 2017",I am a big star wars fan. I was exited to see the new star wars movie only to find I was completely disappointed and left unfulfilled after leaving the theater. I felt that this movie did not go with the flow of all the other star wars movies. It really was a bad movie all the ray around. this movie screamed fail fail fail. there were a lot of pointless plots in the movie. I really wish this movie can be unmade. adding this to the star wars legacy is really sad...,0.5, 
"December 24, 2017","This is a terrible movie, not worthy of being part of the Star Wars saga.

Let me start by saying that I am not a bot, and that I really liked the diverse cast of actors (also including many powerful female characters). People are trying to dismiss any critique to this movie using these arguments (e.g. any disgruntled fan is either a bot or a racist/sexist), but the truth is that TLJ's existential mistake was to completely disregard what a Star Wars movie is.

Star Wars is an epic space saga. It is built on heroes (the jedi) who represent and fight for the values that represent the best in our society. In TLJ, there are no heroes. Luke's character is butchered to the point that he's unrecognizable to anyone who has seen the first 6 movies. I can only agree with Mark Hamill here: I fundamentally disagree to the portrayal of Luke Skywalker in TLJ.

And Rey, the character who was supposed to carry on the torch of the Jedi, gets very little screen time beyond the scenes where she's pestering Luke. Her supposed ""jedi training"" consists of 3 short lessons! So, according to this movie, becoming a jedi takes less effort than passing a lousy online college class. No time is spent on going beyond the surface of her character, letting us know more about her personal journey. At this point, we simply know that she'll magically win any lightsaber fight without any training and without ever getting as much as a minor scratch.

Finn (a clown whose defining trait is cowardice) and Poe (who is active only in a short initial sequence) are not even worthy of being considered ""heroic"" characters. And what about the ""villains""? The supposedly powerful Supreme Leader Snoke gets unceremoniously eliminated in a matter of minutes -no explanation is provided on who he is and where he came from. Kylo Ren continues to be the silly, moody teenager he was in The Force Awakens. These ""villains"" pale in comparison with the epic greatness of Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine!

These flaws are so big, that I won't even venture in listing the numerous plot holes, inconsistencies, or plain boring scenes (who needed the whole casino subplot??).

To sum it up: Star Wars is about epic adventures, great heroes, fearsome villains. The greatest of these heroes is Luke Skywalker. Not only Luke's character is terribly distorted in this movie, but there's no other hero that steps in to fill the void. Rey's story and personality are not developed any further than what (little) we saw in TFA. And on the villains side, we go from disappointingly shallow (Snoke) to utterly repetitive (Kylo ""teenage"" Ren).

I am incredibly disappointing in this movie. Seeing the next Star Wars movies is not a given anymore for me. Renovating the Star Wars saga should not be taken this lightly, Disney.",1, F P
"December 24, 2017","The Last Jedi retells The story of Empire Strikes Back but puts the Hoth scene at the end of the movie instead of leading with it.

Star Wars fans are very disappointed because they waited two years only to get a rehash story....nothing original.

ESB has four parts to it;

Part 1:White covered planet that is under attack by the Empire At-At walkers and the Rebels use land speeders to delay the Empire long enough for the Heroes to get away in the falcon.

Part 2: The Heroes minus the jedi learner are being pursued in a space chase but they can't lose them since they can't go light speed.

Part 3: The jedi learner goes to find the Jedi master to get taught the force but leaves before completing training.

Part 4: The heroes being chased by the Empire come up with a plan to reach out to a shady scoundrel type that can't be trusted but has no other choice and end up getting back stabbed for it.

I've just described all the plot points of The Empire Strikes Back which are the exact same thing that happens in The Last Jedi minus one additional plot which is taken from Return of the Jedi and is almost an exact copy of the Throne Room scene with red guards, very similar dialog and both The Emperor and Snoke are defeated.

Rian Johnson managed to troll the audience with a plot rip off of ESB and added Space Balls comedy that Mel Brooks would be proud of. This was Rian's way of giving the middle finger to the fanboys and adding real world political nonsense to the movie.",0.5, Rob G

"December 24, 2017","My Review: (Spoiler Alert ??)

Star Wars: The Last Jedi was a masterpiece in and of its own right. It took the franchise in new directions and shocked audiences all over, completely splitting the fandom. The movie showed that sometimes you fail and nothing changes (the Finn and Rose storyline for example), it shows that sacrifice is sometimes necessary to save your friends/loved ones (Admiral Holdo's light speed suicide slice through Snoke's starship), it shows that the heros won't win all the time (the retreat from Crait), it shows that even Legends will die (Luke Skywalker's death). It brought to new light that the new hero may come from parents who were literally no one (Rey's Parents). Based on past events, the manner and personality of an old hero may change (how Luke became after the destruction after the Jedi temple). Lastly, it shows that things are not going to go the way you want sometimes. 

Star Wars: The Last Jedi was different than previous films and was better for it. After this movie, my favorite SW movies in order are 5, 8, 4, 7, 6, 3, 1, 2.",4.5, justin b

"December 24, 2017","Incoherent facts, characters, motivations. 

Good action, shots, angles.

Bad light, too dark sometimes.

Beautiful outside and dumb inside. 

This movie threw me some moments sinister, ... or laughed at my face, breaking the little respect I had, to this or that code, SW represented to me.

"December 24, 2017","I felt heartbroken after I've seen this movie. I'm a Star Wars Fan since my childhood, and I liked The Force Awakens and Rogue One.

"December 24, 2017","1 / 10 for me after 2nd viewing. Much worse than first viewing. First time I saw it I was relieved it was not a verbatim copycat like TFA. I loved the play on myths and legends and subverting audience expectations. It seemed clever, fresh. 

Then I just saw it second time an last night. Now I think it is Rubbish. Cardboard characters, inchaote plot, lazy scriptwriting. And was boring to boot. I left the cinema 1 hour in and played with my phone and got a drink and almost didn't feel like coming back. Never happened before with ANY star wars. 

Have little interest in what happens to the new characters - they often do random things anyway and are not developed. No consistency, no proper motivation, not persuasive. And furthermore the hammy humour was often worse than the prequels. 

And Leia Space walking? Luke chucking his saber away right away after being so earnest in TFA. Omniscient' Snoke's laughable demise? A lot of WTF moments that don't fully hit you the first time fully, strike you as terrible the second time. For me at least. 

The entire film felt like a cartoon like Dragonball or Akira with zany and ever expanding force powers that blow buildings apart. Not star wars in tone..I'm no traditionalist,but consistency is important or you lose the cinematic illusion. 

Only good moments for me - the touching Yoda scene and Artoo and luke hologram scene which moved me the first time (but had little impact the second time). Everything else I can forget. Hugely disappointing.

"December 24, 2017",I am a big star wars fan. I was exited to see the new star wars movie only to find I was completely disappointed and left unfulfilled after leaving the theater.

It really was a bad movie all the ray around. this movie screamed fail fail fail. there were a lot of pointless plots in the movie. I really wish this movie can be unmade. adding this to the star wars legacy is really sad...,0.5, 
"December 24, 2017","This is a terrible movie, not worthy of being part of the Star Wars saga.

Let me start by saying that I am not a bot, and that I really liked the diverse cast of actors (also including many powerful female characters). People are trying to dismiss any critique to this movie using these arguments (e.g. any disgruntled fan is either a bot or a racist/sexist), but the truth is that TLJ's existential mistake was to completely disregard what a Star Wars movie is.

Star Wars is an epic space saga. It is built on heroes (the jedi) who represent and fight for the values that represent the best in our society. In TLJ, there are no heroes. Luke's character is butchered to the point that he's unrecognizable to anyone who has seen the first 6 movies. I can only agree with Mark Hamill here: I fundamentally disagree to the portrayal of Luke Skywalker in TLJ.

And Rey, the character who was supposed to carry on the torch of the Jedi, gets very little screen time beyond the scenes where she's pestering Luke. Her supposed ""jedi training"" consists of 3 short lessons! So, according to this movie, becoming a jedi takes less effort than passing a lousy online college class. No time is spent on going beyond the surface of her character, letting us know more about her personal journey. At this point, we simply know that she'll magically win any lightsaber fight without any training and without ever getting as much as a minor scratch.

Finn (a clown whose defining trait is cowardice) and Poe (who is active only in a short initial sequence) are not even worthy of being considered ""heroic"" characters. And what about the ""villains""? The supposedly powerful Supreme Leader Snoke gets unceremoniously eliminated in a matter of minutes -no explanation is provided on who he is and where he came from. Kylo Ren continues to be the silly, moody teenager he was in The Force Awakens. These ""villains"" pale in comparison with the epic greatness of Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine!

These flaws are so big, that I won't even venture in listing the numerous plot holes, inconsistencies, or plain boring scenes (who needed the whole casino subplot??).

To sum it up: Star Wars is about epic adventures, great heroes, fearsome villains. The greatest of these heroes is Luke Skywalker. Not only Luke's character is terribly distorted in this movie, but there's no other hero that steps in to fill the void. Rey's story and personality are not developed any further than what (little) we saw in TFA. And on the villains side, we go from disappointingly shallow (Snoke) to utterly repetitive (Kylo ""teenage"" Ren).

I am incredibly disappointing in this movie. Seeing the next Star Wars movies is not a given anymore for me. Renovating the Star Wars saga should not be taken this lightly, Disney.",1, F P
"December 24, 2017","The Last Jedi retells The story of Empire Strikes Back but puts the Hoth scene at the end of the movie instead of leading with it.

Star Wars fans are very disappointed because they waited two years only to get a rehash story....nothing original.

ESB has four parts to it;

Part 1:White covered planet that is under attack by the Empire At-At walkers and the Rebels use land speeders to delay the Empire long enough for the Heroes to get away in the falcon.

Part 2: The Heroes minus the jedi learner are being pursued in a space chase but they can't lose them since they can't go light speed.

Part 3: The jedi learner goes to find the Jedi master to get taught the force but leaves before completing training.

Part 4: The heroes being chased by the Empire come up with a plan to reach out to a shady scoundrel type that can't be trusted but has no other choice and end up getting back stabbed for it.

I've just described all the plot points of The Empire Strikes Back which are the exact same thing that happens in The Last Jedi minus one additional plot which is taken from Return of the Jedi and is almost an exact copy of the Throne Room scene with red guards, very similar dialog and both The Emperor and Snoke are defeated.

"December 24, 2017","My Review: (Spoiler Alert ??)

Star Wars: The Last Jedi was a masterpiece in and of its own right. It took the franchise in new directions and shocked audiences all over, completely splitting the fandom. The movie showed that sometimes you fail and nothing changes (the Finn and Rose storyline for example), it shows that sacrifice is sometimes necessary to save your friends/loved ones (Admiral Holdo's light speed suicide slice through Snoke's starship), it shows that the heros won't win all the time (the retreat from Crait), it shows that even Legends will die (Luke Skywalker's death). It brought to new light that the new hero may come from parents who were literally no one (Rey's Parents). Based on past events, the manner and personality of an old hero may change (how Luke became after the destruction after the Jedi temple). Lastly, it shows that things are not going to go the way you want sometimes. 

Star Wars: The Last Jedi was different than previous films and was better for it. After this movie, my favorite SW movies in order are 5, 8, 4, 7, 6, 3, 1, 2.",4.5, justin b

"December 24, 2017","Star Wars - The Last Jedi Review

Honestly, probably spoilers, no idea, haven't written it yet.

Ok, so we saw TLJ last night. I was taken back for a moment to my 7th birthday watching the original Star Wars in Omaha NB. Heck, it was in the movie theaters for over a year, so I think even at that age I saw it 7-8 times.

I was taken back to those dark ages when The Star Wars Trilogy was just that.. We didn't have things like the MCU or DCU, sequels were still new and Star Wars stood alone as something special.

But now, the SWU is just another property to be treated like sausage...just one link after another being ground out from ILM and Disney...Can you tell I'm not thrilled?

Ok, going to work backwards. The rebel fleet is down to one cruiser and a few support ships? That's all? No massive rebel alliance fighting against the evil empire? And that Evil Empire is down to a dreadnought class behemoth that can be destroyed with one tiny bomber load and an X-Wing blowing up some surface turrets? All I can guess is that after losing 2 death stars and a planet base, the Empire is more or less broke and couldn't borrow any more money from the Hutt Clan for another fleet of big guns....Disappointing. It all boils down to a command shuttle and a doze or so AtAt walkers against some mine for the Empire and the Rebels all fit on the Millennium Falcon?

Sorry folks, but if we're to believe this...there is a whole big universe of people getting along with their daily lives really not caring about either the Empire or the Rebel Alliance and likely making a good living as a moisture farmer or Expert Pod Racer some place.

Where is the grand scale? The massive industrial cities? It just feels like this whole episode fit into a fanny pack on the belt of some insignificant tourist...

And, I'm all for equality, but since when did the rebel council all turn into women wearing Grecian togas? Give me Jen Urso in her battle gear from Rouge One. Give me Bad Ass women in charge and ready to head into battle...Not Carrie Fisher and Laura Dern heading up to the Oracle or floating back into an airlock from empty space.

I thought back to the originals...with planet and system killing destroying machines...One blast and entire civilizations were vaporized... and compare that to Snokes threat that he's going to kill Reyn and go down and blow up the ""Whole Island"" where Luke is. Ok... yeah..I'm scared...the WHOLE ISLAND?

I get and understand that they are clearing the decks for new characters and story lines. But the smallness of this episode leaves me feeling that the universe is doing just fine, that for most folks they get along day to day without much of a care for the rebels or the empire...and that really what are we fighting for after all.

Bring back the grandeur and scale, or let's allow ILM to come up with something new and different to amaze us all. Let's put Star Wars to bed and move on to something else...

"December 24, 2017","With this new trilogy the big ""lesson"" is that none of the lore matters, a nobody (that much would make sense), with no clue of what is doing, can become a powerful Jedi out of nowhere, no training, no mentor, no nothing, and that's about it, seriously? For the sake of ""originality"" they managed to crush an entire mythology with one swift stroke. Our beloved heroes from the original trilogy are disrespected, reduced to a sketchy caricature, killed off mercilessly, with plenty of plot holes, pointless story-lines, unnecessary characters, multiple (FU) gotcha moments in the face of fans, deceiving the audience with glittery flashy nonsense. Because it turns out that even powerful characters like Snoke do no matter after all, and can be wiped out very easily.

George Lucas had a vision of hope and balance. All the glory, all the legendary myths, all the values, all the epicness, sadly is all lost with this new Star Wars movies.? The intention with the diversity was good, but on top of all the criticisms, I just had the weirdest realization ever. Every main male character in this movie is either ditched, proved wrong or made look like a fool by a female character. Luke and Kylo are proved wrong, ditched and made look like fools by Rey. Poe is proved wrong, made look like a fool and ditched by Admiral Holdo, Finn is made look like a fool by Rose. Interesting recurring element to say the least...

Star Wars was originally a space-opera, now has become a messy money making action flick, inconsistent, hollow, heavily political, in no way meaningful or memorable. So, there you have it, an entire mythology violated, subverted and destroyed, for what? Nothing. I rest my case.",1, Francesco A

Glad that the evolution of the stir tidbit that all lines are not as concrete as some fans would want be blurred be unpredictable this is a perfect evaluation to force balance and at the end of the day this is a force story not a sky walker story he was tool by the force and now the force is choosing others to continue the battle that is the balance of light and dark.. peace!

There are basically no breaks whatsoever, the characters never get adequately fleshed out, the constant jokes ruin almost every serious moment, and the plot was literally useless, telling us what we already knew: Kylo Ren is a terrible ***hole.

Not to mention instead of actually fleshing out the character's, Rian Johnson completely butchers them. The treatment both Finn and Poe get are incredibly racist and go against who they are entirely, and Rose is there... to just be there. Her character is basically pointless and that is so, so disappointing and upsetting. She deserved more. And now Luke Skywalker... Rian did an extreme disservice to our beloved hero. Not only is he incredibly out of character, but what they did to him in reference to the end of the movie shouldn't have been done in a Star Wars film as terrible as this.

Plus there are so many plot holes it's absolutely ridiculous... The whole movie basically just goes against everything Star Wars stands for.

I can understand Rian Johnson and the crew's push for change in Star Wars, and I agree that there does need to be a change for the end of the saga, but this movie brought NOTHING good or new (in a useful sense) to the table.

"December 24, 2017","This should summarize the billiance of this movie

Top notch characterization:

Rey- Learned she was nobody, so it's severely affected her outlook on the world by changing nothing about her.

Ren- Didn't kill his mom, then talks about how Luke almost killing him made him want to kill everyone, creating an absurd amount of sympathy for him to kill the past by killing the Resistance based on his past.

Finn- Tried to act like a hero, failed, then killed Plasma, then failed. Learned to protect people by not protecting people.

Rose- Had her sister sacrifice herself, so tells Finn not to sacrifice himself for the cause. Learned to love a person for no appealing traits.

Poe- Gets demoted for two seconds, tries to save everyone from dying since leadership has no plan, learning to be a leader by mind reading Luke and regurgitating phrases.

Luke- Attempts to kill nephew, then stops right before, nephew killed everyone under him except non-existent knights of ren. Got depressed and learned to not be a complete wimp, right before dying like a wimp.

This movie changes my life. By not only subverting my expectations, but also having nothing make sense in the plot, like the code cracker knowing about the secret escape from the shuttle through the Force. I thought they would make an interesting movie, but I got nonsensical. 9.5/10

Not enough porg

Edit: Oh my goodness, how could I forget! When Rey asks why he killed his dad, he is trying to distract her from the question by being topless. This adds a whole new layer of how nefarious and capable he is. It works too, because he doesn't answer the question and she not only forgets about it, but feel even more sympathy for him.

"December 24, 2017","Interesting how high the Tomatometer score is on this latest installment of the SW saga...after giving myself 24 hours to digest it, I must say my reaction to it is a big meh. Despite having the same nucleus of pt. 7 that made that film work so well (despite that film's deficiencies), this one blew it on at least a few things. First, the cartoonish portrayal of Hux was a let down; second, the depiction of Poe was also disappointing (what the hell was with Leia's slap??!). Meanwhile, the various subplots with supporting characters were mostly underwhelming. Despite some cool new/old vehicles and special effects and the generally pleasing interactions between Rey and Kylo, the film is a big disappointment--this coming, if I must say, from a diehard SW fan as a kid--that smacks as little more than one cash-grab for another (i.e., episode 9). While I was generally satisfied with Luke's portrayal, I was a bit let down with his death (though my 8-year-old son was fine with it).

The Rose and Fin story line is just pointless and Fin and Rose have zero chemistry. It really felt like the Rose character was plucked off of a Disney afternoon teen comedy. Love Rae ...that was some good casting and in the Force Awakens all of the new characters have great chemistry. The Last Jedi just doesn't give them anything to work with.

"December 24, 2017","Look, when I first saw the film I came out with issues. It's actually in hindsight that I'm starting appreciate it. There are some aspects I think are still useless (Holdo's role in the film would have a stronger impact if filled by an established character, for instance). But the acting is on point across the board (holy crap does Driver bring it this time), it's visually stunning, and it really tries to be it's own thing. I might disgree with Rian's vision, but if this is the vision we're going to be getting I still enjoy it.",4.5, David K
"December 24, 2017",Don't even know where to begin. This is simply not a Star Wars film.

Don't even want to watch the next episode.,0.5, 
"December 24, 2017","Waste of time. Plotting and boring, this film is the epitome of using a franchise name to push bland, uninventive, derivitive, and weak storytelling. Characters are unrelatable and surface level, dialogue is forced, sigh inducing, and eye rollingly prolonged, and the action/fx are absolutely not worth the struggle. Music is tame and uninspired.

"December 24, 2017","I grew up watching Star Wars after being introduced to it by my dad, Luke was a childhood hero of mine. This movie destroyed that, this among other reasons has left me completely uninterested in watching episode 9, or any stand alone. God help the Obi-Wan trilogy...

The good: visually impressive, and John Williams score was fantastic as always

The bad: jeez... Where do I start?

The pacing: It reached a point where I was looking at my watch to see how long was left. I was initially excited for a 2.5 hour Star Wars film, that changed, I was uninterested and disengaged.

They mishandled Luke, and the Force. Everyone else has said it.

Holdo was unnecessary, her role should have been given to Admiral Ackbar.

Space Leia...

The SJW, PC subplot that was Canto Bight, and Rose deeming the mission a success because they freed some space horses that will literally be recaptured in a week.

Rey's nobody parents culminating in her almost mastery of the force.

I've never felt the need to review a movie before. The Last Jedi got so many things wrong that I'm still angry about it a week after seeing it and I felt the need to put it in writing.",0.5,

Besides one action scene I hated everything about it. Was bored and annoyed throughout it. Audience including me had little to no reaction throughout the movie. There was barely any laughs at the parts that supposed to be funny. At the end of the movie one person started to clap but stopped suddenly realizing that no one was clapping with him or her and a woman in front of me as I walked out turned to her friend and said at least someone liked the movie which made laugh more than the movie did.,1, al p

I expected a downer movie, like Empire strikes back. I didn't expect a bloated 2 hr 20 min of cheap emotional manipulation that was beyond depressing.

The pacing was horrible and the plot weaker than weak - what WAS the point of the movie? Besides battering the audience and providing the opportunity for lots of flashy CGI and cool special effects? Please.

Don't waste your money! Oh, and I will NEVER see a film involving JJ Abrams again. Never. Star Trek was pretty much destroyed by Rick Berman but he drove the last nails into the coffin, and now he's finished what Lucas started with the weak prequel trilogy.",1, Laura L

"December 24, 2017","The Last Jedi was seriously too much. There are basically no breaks whatsoever, the characters never get adequately fleshed out, the constant jokes ruin almost every serious moment, and the plot was literally useless, telling us what we already knew: Kylo Ren is a terrible ***hole.

Not to mention instead of actually fleshing out the character's, Rian Johnson completely butchers them. The treatment both Finn and Poe get are incredibly racist and go against who they are entirely, and Rose is there... to just be there. Her character is basically pointless and that is so, so disappointing and upsetting. She deserved more. And now Luke Skywalker... Rian did an extreme disservice to our beloved hero. Not only is he incredibly out of character, but what they did to him in reference to the end of the movie shouldn't have been done in a Star Wars film as terrible as this.

Plus there are so many plot holes it's absolutely ridiculous... The whole movie basically just goes against everything Star Wars stands for.

I can understand Rian Johnson and the crew's push for change in Star Wars, and I agree that there does need to be a change for the end of the saga, but this movie brought NOTHING good or new (in a useful sense) to the table. It went too far and now it's just a horrible mess, and fails as the second addition to a trilogy.

There's so much more I could say, but I don't want this to get too long.",0.5, Ashley G

"December 24, 2017","Thank you Mr.Johnson that you destroyed a whole generation`s love for the Star Wars universe. Thank you for making a Hollywood money cow with incoherent story where vital questions are not just left unanswered, but made irrelevant. Thank you for making a movie where it`s hard to decide whether it was written for toddlers or adults, with its out of place comedy elements but with ever present soft toy characters. Thank you for destroying Luke Skywalker`s character which proved to me that you did not bother watching the first trilogy.Thank you I say, because you saved me all the money I would have spent on future Star Wars movies. ...And you George Lucas? I wonder how it must feel for you seeing your brainchild, your legacy dismantled and losing the fanbase which made this franchise really great...or I guess it`s enough counting your money. Anyway...

"December 24, 2017","This is the first time I posted on Rotten Tomatoes. But as a long time Star Wars fan I felt I had to give voice after watching this movie and seeing the hypocrisy of the ""Official Score"". Whatever hope I had for Disney in carrying on the spirit of Star Wars died with this film. They took one of our most beloved characters, disregarded all of the character developments from the original trilogy and assassinated his character. This is only one of the many issues I have with this film, but read on the and you'll hear similar criticism of the movie (along with spoilers) about why this movie doesn't deserve the rating it has.

Just look at the divide between the audience score and the critics here (as well as Metacritic) and it will show you why critic opinions are, at best not reflective of the average viewer experience or at worse, paid off and influenced by the corporations that make the films and thus afraid to voice out a real opinion.",0.5,

"December 24, 2017","This should summarize the billiance of this movie

Top notch characterization:

Rey- Learned she was nobody, so it's severely affected her outlook on the world by changing nothing about her.

Ren- Didn't kill his mom, then talks about how Luke almost killing him made him want to kill everyone, creating an absurd amount of sympathy for him to kill the past by killing the Resistance based on his past.

Finn- Tried to act like a hero, failed, then killed Plasma, then failed. Learned to protect people by not protecting people.

Rose- Had her sister sacrifice herself, so tells Finn not to sacrifice himself for the cause. Learned to love a person for no appealing traits.

Poe- Gets demoted for two seconds, tries to save everyone from dying since leadership has no plan, learning to be a leader by mind reading Luke and regurgitating phrases.

Luke- Attempts to kill nephew, then stops right before, nephew killed everyone under him except non-existent knights of ren. Got depressed and learned to not be a complete wimp, right before dying like a wimp.

This movie changes my life. By not only subverting my expectations, but also having nothing make sense in the plot, like the code cracker knowing about the secret escape from the shuttle through the Force. I thought they would make an interesting movie, but I got nonsensical. 9.5/10

Not enough porg

Edit: Oh my goodness, how could I forget! When Rey asks why he killed his dad, he is trying to distract her from the question by being topless. This adds a whole new layer of how nefarious and capable he is. It works too, because he doesn't answer the question and she not only forgets about it, but feel even more sympathy for him. Thanks for reminding me of a crucial part of Johnson's bold vision of nonsense. Let me bump the score up to properly include this.?

9.8/10?",0.5, Anirudh V
"December 24, 2017","Interesting how high the Tomatometer score is on this latest installment of the SW saga...after giving myself 24 hours to digest it, I must say my reaction to it is a big meh. Despite having the same nucleus of pt. 7 that made that film work so well (despite that film's deficiencies), this one blew it on at least a few things. First, the cartoonish portrayal of Hux was a let down; second, the depiction of Poe was also disappointing (what the hell was with Leia's slap??!). Meanwhile, the various subplots with supporting characters were mostly underwhelming. Despite some cool new/old vehicles and special effects and the generally pleasing interactions between Rey and Kylo, the film is a big disappointment--this coming, if I must say, from a diehard SW fan as a kid--that smacks as little more than one cash-grab for another (i.e., episode 9). While I was generally satisfied with Luke's portrayal, I was a bit let down with his death (though my 8-year-old son was fine with it). Overall, the filmmakers wimped out on this one and could have blown us away; instead, they've gotta make more money and sell more tickets.",2.5, John F
"December 24, 2017","After one of the greatest Star Wars movies (Rogue One), Disney and the new leadership of LucasFilm (Looking at you, Kathleen Kennedy) proves that they have no idea on what do to with Star Wars.

Episode VIII doesn't move the plot forward, does not answer any questions, and destroys everything in the Star Wars mythology.

It's hear breaking to think this is the end of Star Wars that we all know and love. We are entering the dark era where Disney will release anything just to get our money.

But remember, this might backfire on them if we join efforts. 

I for one, choose to rebel, and I will NEVER, EVER from this point on, pay to watch any Disney produced movie ever, nor will buy any Disney merchandise until they fix what they did with Star Wars.

The Bad:

- Inconsistent, even within the new franchise. Somehow, mid-franchise the director forgets the end of the last movie, having the rebels on the run instead of the offensive. Also, why would Luke make a map if he didn't want to be found/help?

- Additional secondary characters and locations that have no point beyond time wasting dramatic filler. Rose, Admiral Pink Hair, Casino Planet. Though the acting coming from these characters was somewhat of a redeeming factor.

- Corny and at times creepy jokes. Luke milking a space walrus?!

The Good:

- On all accounts the acting was good.

- The visuals & design were amazing.

- Luke no longer has to live on an Island full of goofy fish people and odd daily milking rituals

"December 24, 2017","My initial thoughts on the last jedi was one of disappointment, let me elaborate

Positives on the movie: - 

 Visually and technically a beautiful movie

 Some excellent battle scenes

Negatives and there are many: - 

 Removing Snoke so early in the movie was a very bad move, a strong evil figure was needed in this movie. 

 I can understand Luke going down the side of not giving a monkeys about the force due to his failure in training his nephew, however when Luke returned at the end to help out, the movie was crying out for Luke to kick some butt. Instead we get Luke transporting himself and then passing out with exhaustion at the end of it... not a good way out for a legend. 

 Way too many subplots and twists, I get a modern day Star Wars need to advance and keep the audience on the edge of their seats, but to have this many subplots and twists messed it up too much in my opinion. 

 Rey and Kylo chatting to each other using the force came across a bit silly, not too mention a few other scenes, such as the superman flying through space scene and Luke milking the alien.

Bottom line I completely understand why there is a backlash against this movie, the faithful star wars fans have every right to poo all over this movie. I also understand that the franchise needed to take a new turn, I just think the turn they made was not thought through fully and came across as a bit slapstick.

Instead we get Luke transporting himself and then passing out with exhaustion at the end of it... not a good way out for a legend. 

 Way too many subplots and twists, I get a modern day Star Wars need to advance and keep the audience on the edge of their seats, but to have this many subplots and twists messed it up too much in my opinion. 

 Rey and Kylo chatting to each other using the force came across a bit silly, not too mention a few other scenes, such as the superman flying through space scene and Luke milking the alien.

Bottom line I completely understand why there is a backlash against this movie, the faithful star wars fans have every right to poo all over this movie. I also understand that the franchise needed to take a new turn, I just think the turn they made was not thought through fully and came across as a bit slapstick.",1, Sanjay S

"December 24, 2017","This is the movie that ended my passion for Star Wars. Disney has ruined something that has captivated my attention for around two decades now. Between the movies and scores of Star Wars books,that passion is now destroyed by this awful attempt to produce a coherent story. 

The movie was essentially a mash of elements from episode 4, 5 & 6 of the Star Wars saga. 

Honestly, they should have just kept everything from the books Cannon and brought new actors into the fold, because as it is, it destroyed everything. They dare to make the books not Cannon anymore and then still use elements from the books? 

FUCK THAT!

Straight up, almost walked out when Luke was fighting Kylo-Ren just because I thought he was all of sudden immortal. Only to realize he was using a force projection, (which if you didn't read the books, no one who watches the movies would ever know what the fuck that is) but once he became apart of the force, that's what made me walk the fuck out.

You straight up ruin a bad ass character like Luke, then you get rid of him. 

Sure, he could come back as Force ghost type deal, but what the fuck was the point of even putting him in the film then?!

RUINED. MY LOVE FOR STAR WARS IS RUINED!

"December 24, 2017","Spoiler Alerts Throughout: You might come out the other end feeling like a rotten banana. 

I've now had a day to ponder what exactly it was I witnessed yesterday in the theatre. I reserved seats with my family and prepared for a sumptuous Christmas treat. My step daughter had previously seen it and I had asked for absolutely no opinions which she obliged to admirably. For all intents and purposes, I entered the theatre bathed in a fresh wash of midi-chlorians: I was free from media bias and friendly opinions, a 'Last Jedi' virgin!

My first grimace came after an intergalactic version of call waiting remorse. The brilliant strategy of the rebel fleet (most notably Poe as Leia tried to distance herself from such a childish stunt) was to delay the amassed First Order by playing clueless with General Hux via ship to ship communications? Yes, I admit I laughed; with a little cringe, but inside my nerve endings were tensing. Was this how it was going to be for the rest of the movie??? 

And to a certain degree it was... Without splaying out the guts of the entire movie I can say it was slathered with cheap gags, political correctness, terrible ineffectual subplots, ridiculous strategies and outcomes and a complete trouncing of the force; BB8 became a slot machine, mansplaining Poe got a slap down, a whole quarter or third of the movie resulted in nothing furthering the plot, miraculous rebel bases appearing and surprise hyperspace rebel ship ballistics (really???) interspersed with notions of messing with the most important aspect of Star Wars: the Force.... Let me explain...

Han Solo died in the last instalment and with him the embodiment of the Star Wars I liked. He was tongue in cheek, daring and courageous. But most importantly, he tapped into that gut intuition, that fly by your pants recklessness, that last minute brilliant insight that is part genius and part insane. This is what makes great drama and fun adventure. To me this is the non-Jedi use of the force. ""Never tell me the odds!"" Instead we are presented with the best rebel pilot being beaten down for his instinct?!? He is denied and kicked out of the inner decision making circle. Let's face it - the rebellion is practically a non-existent ragtag fleet by this point. They need to be reckless and take daring risks. (Remember this is drama not reality. IMO real world politics have no place in a 2.5 hour space adventure movie). I know many will say that there is still plenty of daring to be had but in my mind the writers really took a cheap political shot at pissing on Han Solo's grave. It made me feel ill. And it stuck with me throughout the entire movie.

Lastly, I believe Luke Skywalker got the short end of the stick. His little screw up created a Sith Lord??? Oh really?? And what now, he's having an edge of the galaxy 'woe is me' temper tantrum? In my mind, highly trained Jedi Masters don't have little screw ups. Its just not in their nature. Their midi-chlorians wouldn't allow it. Any person who can fish with a 200 ft fishing spear without using the force is not going to have little galactic altering screw ups. Seriously ridiculous...

If only this movie could be erased from the Star Wars canon. Go away Disney and take your space faring Mary Poppins with you!

I could go on and on. I wanted to walk out in the last 15 minutes. 

In the car ride home I discovered that I was the only one so damning of the 'Last Jedi'. For the most part, the millennial teens in my car liked it. Polarizing? No doubt! Empire Strikes Back it is not! I had high hopes after loving Rogue One. The Last Jedi has sunk far to the bottom for me in a galaxy not so far away it seems. I'll end on a positive note. I really liked DJ (the slinky code cracker character played by Benicio Del Torro). He had my favourite line in the movie. I can't quite remember it but it was something like ""flibidy floop"" or maybe it was ""blibidiy blop""?",1.5, Willem B

"December 24, 2017","I grew up with Star Wars, and I know the ways of a Jedi better than Rian Johnson. Luke's demise was completely out of the character development of his past solid storyline and in his Jedi training. It was poor writing to get rid of Mark Hamill likely at Disney's request or KK. The movie was too long. The Canto Brite scene was unnecessary and impractical considering the Rebel fleet only had 6 hours of fuel remaining. Shoddy writing. Star Wars had a good run but it stinks now. It made this much money only because fans had to pay to go see it before they could hate it. You see, fans had HOPE, which is what a Jedi always has.....and Luke would have had. Rian Johnson didn't understand that. There's a reason this movie made less than TFA. I'm sure the 3rd installment will make even less money. The Force is no longer strong in Star Wars. Corporate greed, power, and political agendas are though. Don't see it.",0.5, DC B

"December 24, 2017","I really liked the movie. I should watch it again perhaps, and I still need to think about everything, but the general Star Wars symbolism that I love so much was sooo there. 

Cause and effect, we know how the Force works.

I also had no problem with Luke's characterisation, which I know some disagree with. He's not the 23-year-old young Jedi who faced his father and the Emperor. So I never expected him to be exactly the way he used to be when he was younger. So it wasn't just seeing Luke again... it was learning who he was now, what he's been through since we last saw him, as opposed to who he used to be. Seeing the man too, not just the legend. He will always be my favourite and TLJ changed none of that.",5, Éva V

"December 24, 2017","Extremely disappointed in this movie. I've never wrote a review for this website but I had to..here are some of the parts I disliked (most of the movie).

CONS:

- Portraying Luke Skywalker, someone full of hope, as a nephew murderer. Luke, in the original trilogy, saw that tiny little bit of light in Darth Vader and tried to turn him back to the light. In this movie he sees a some darkness in Ben and immediately thinks that he needs to be destroyed. On top of that, his humor and pessimistic behavior is just not him.

- Leia flying, what was that? RIP Carrie but why is she still alive in the movie? They so many chances to have her go off in a good way: tie fighters taking her out to show that Kylo couldn't bring himself to do it or having her stay on the ship instead of the pink-haired character. If they announce her death in the opening crawl in Ep. 9, I will walk out of the theater.

- The completely pointless hour of subplot with Finn and Rose.. If the pink-haired admiral would have told Poe and the rest of the the Resistance that they were planning to escape to an abandoned rebel base to flee from the Empire, this would have happened. Finn, Rose, and Poe would have never tried to break into Snoke's ship meaning they would not have gone to Canto Bight, met the hacker who betrayed them and got a bunch of Rebel transports blown up on the way to Crait. They would have just stuck with the escape plan all along.

- Unnecessary humor and scenes..Why did they have to add in a scene where Kylo was shirtless and Rey acknowledges it? like cmon...some of the humor was god awful. 

- Killing Snoke off with no explanation of who he is or how he came into power. They literally copy and pasted Emperor Palpatine into this movie despite the fact in the canon novelization of Force Awakens, they claim he has ""been around for the rise and fall of the Empire"". This would mean that he would have existed during Sidious' reign but someone wasn't sensed. If he was so powerful to hide himself from the most powerful Sith lord, how did he get killed by the oldest trick in the book? He was able to connect the minds of two force users but couldn't sense a lightsaber to his side. Waste of a potentially great character.

- No true lightsaber duel.

- Setting up the next movie to be extremely predictable: Rey fights Kylo and Rey wins, Resistance builds up from nothing and beats the First Order.

- Trying to develop new characters before fleshing out characters from the 7th movie. That scene at the end of the movie with the force-sensitive kid and the broom...that should have been at the end of the 9th movie to set up a new trilogy. Instead those kids will probably be huge parts of the 9th movie. 

PROS:

- Looks good. (Expected)

- Rey is a great character. I love that her parents are nobodies, much like other Jedi, she is without force-sensitive parents.

- Kylo developed better than I expected him to. I didn't like him in the 7th movie very much.

- Snoke scenes were awesome and the battle against the guard was great.",0.5, Ian P
"December 24, 2017","!!!SPOILERS ALERT!!!

This is a different Star Wars. A Star Wars I'm not familiar with. But at the same time, it's a Star Wars I like a lot. It's really hard to say whether TLJ is better than the others or not (we do know the answer when it comes to the prequels) since it is different. So let's talk about the things I liked about TLJ.

TLJ had a lot of humor and there was a little bit of darkness in it as well. It wasn't that dark as I expected but it did had some dark elements in it. The humor in this movie was incredible. It had me every time. The movie it self was beautifully shot. I liked the scenes in the island a lot! They were in my opinion quite deep. The action in this movie was good as well. Really good! (Puppet) Yoda was in it (that was the expectation that seemed to be true) as well and I loved that. Okay, maybe he didn't look that great but it was still enormously pleasing to see our old little green and wise friend. Rey had some conversations with Kylo by using the force and that was great to see. That is something that made TLJ differ from the other Star Wars movies. The Canto Bight scenes were okay. 

Okay, those were the good things. What were the negative things? Two words: plot points. I had a lot of questions about Snoke and Rey. Snoke was killed by Kylo Ren (whose acting was superb) at almost the last part of the movie. I'm quite dissatisfied with this decision. Who is Snoke? Where is he from? WHAT IS HIS ORIGIN? Those questions weren't answered in TLJ since he was cut in half by his apprentice. I do get the point why Rian Johnson took this decision. Rian said: ""When I was working on the character of Kylo, I came to a place where I thought the most interesting thing would be to knock the shaky foundation out from under him at the beginning of this movie...By the end of this film, he's gone from being a wannabe Vader to someone who is standing on his own feet as a complex villain taking the reins."" That is a good reason. But come on! Couldn't you just answer those questions first and then chop him with a light saber? Anyways, it happened. And Rey? Rey's biggest question is answered. Who are here parents? The answer is that they were nobody. Just some junks who sold her for drinking money.......... That answer could have been way better. However this is something that is said by Kylo. I hope that what Kylo said isn't true. I really do since this is just a bad answer to a major plot point. 

And now, the ending. The ending starts when Kylo chops Snoke in half. Rey and Kylo then starts to fight Snoke's red guard (yes, Rey & Kylo. Rey came to Snoke's ship to confront Kylo and turn him back to the light side). My god that scene looked awesome as f*ck. It was so awesome to see Rey and Kylo teaming up and beating the hell out of those red guards. Then, Vice Adm. Holdo enters hyperspace with a resistance cruiser called the Raddus. And no, she isn't escaping from the First Order. In fact she just flies directly into Snoke's ship. That scene... that scene was so incredible. It was so mind blowing. Rey escapes after having a fight with Kylo again, Kylo declares himself new Supreme Leader and the rebellions, who escaped from the Raduss since the First Order attacks and follows them the whole time, move to the planet Crait where there is a rebel base. In there there's going to be a huge fight between the Rebelliance and the First Order following a fight between Kylo and hologram Luke (which meants Luke's death). The Rebelliance needs to escape again and Rey offers them the help by putting them all in the Falcon. What an amazing and climatic ending. The ending was a bit too long but I don't mind that since it was so... good! After that whole event, you see three little kids on the planet Canto Bight talking about the event in Crait. Those little orphans are also slaves. So when one of them, a boy, moves outside to clean things up, he grabs a broom with the force, looks up in the sky and sees hope. That very ending was enormously interesting. It means something. 

This movie isn't excellent nor great. Therefore I give it a 4 1/2. It was so good but they should give themselves more time to think of those plot points. The ending was really good and the very ending was interesting. I'm satisfied with the TLJ and all that hate of it is totally unnecessary. 

Before ending my review on TLJ, I do have got one question. How are they going to solve the Leia problem. Unfortunately Carrie Fisher died after the production of TLJ. And in the end of the movie, Leia's still alive. So I still wonder how they will solve this problem in episode nine.",4.5, Matien A

"December 24, 2017","Why Last Jedi is bad:

Deliberate cliffhangers. Aside from 1-3, where they are more like a single movie broken up into 3 parts, the movies hadn't deliberately left major plot points teased, but unanswered.

Sure, we didn't find out Darth was Luke's father until Empire, but we didn't know it was an issue until then either.

We didn't find out Luke and Leia were siblings until RotJ, but didn't know it was an issue until then, either.

This time, they deliberately set up a Rey family plotline, then have deliberately not solved it. They tease ideas from the expanded unverse, but don't go all-in, or explain them.

The entire ""tracker disable"" subplot seems like someone read the finished script, then said ""that's fine, but it'd be better with a mini-Rogue One shoehorned into the middle."" No, it's not. It just slowed things down, and distracted from the main plot.

Cut that while subplot, and the movie gets better. Cut it before you start shooting, and you spend more time on the training montage.

It's also the first (outside 2-3) that's hard to watch/follow as a stand-alone. The first 4 (made, not episode numbers) are quite watchable without having seen any others or knowing what Star Wars is. This one fails on that. It assumes you've seen Awakens, but doesn't assume you know the rest, so it seems inconsistent. And that makes people uncomfortable, even if they can't understand why at the screening.

Shorten in. You know more movies are being made after, so don't rush plot points, or include too many, just to tick boxes. Simplify and it'll be better. More time for action. More time for training. More time for plot. So it'll be a fuller, more well rounded movie. The ""plot"" seemed to be small justifications for more action. The action was all over the place, but it didn't seem as plot-driven as it needed to be.

In all, that made the movie more a mess than masterpiece. It's enjoyable now, but if the next is any good, this will be the most forgettable of the lot. A filler to get from #1 to #3. Empire was never that. This movie tried to be Empire, while avoiding Empire so much that it never found its identity. It could have been a shot for shot remake of Empire, with some dialogue updates for the changes, and been better than what we got.

It was bad because it would have been so easy to have made it better.",3, Marc W

Luke, from single-handedly bringing down the Emperor and Darth Vader to now being scared to do anything and staying in his island elderly care center. On the bad guys side, Snoke was dumb enough to be betrayed and chopped like an onion just when he was saying that nobody could betray him. Kylo needs help to beat the pretorians ... what a difference with Darth Vader, Count Doku, Darth Maul, Palpatine. The bad guys were just lame ... a couple bums that tried to be bad guys and playing with light sabers. On another main character, Rey was doing great in the Force Awakens and during half of this movie, I was really looking forward to learn her origins .... daughter of Obi-Wan, Luke, Han Solo ... but of course, no epic origins at all; she was just sold by her parents for alcohol. I have the feeling that this new ""director"" was fighting inner ghosts of not being able to do anything comparable to the original trilogies and decided to just destroy it all .... and also trying to come out with some new and shocking story elements but at the same time trying not to follow theories posted by fans that at the end he just made a bunch of non sense in the name of ""originality"". The theories that Snoke was Darth Plagueis and that Rey was daugther or Obi-Was were really cool; a great movie and story could come out of that. This director should not be allowed to touch any Star Wars film/series/book/toy/mugs/toys for ever!!! He should move to a Galaxy Far Far Away.",0.5, David E
"December 24, 2017","I give it a 1 and 1/2 stars because there is only really 1 and a half scenese that were entertaining. The rest became annoying disaster that will leave me pondering what horror of a Star Wars film did I just watch?

Spoiler Alert! I am going to get extremely detailed on a ton of issues in this movie and some into the new series.

First, this movie is a blatant insult to all the fans of Star Wars who have followed the series to some good degree. This fails to deliver good story telling and follow up to TFA (The Force Awakens). I'm gonna save the best for last. If you want to see a MAJOR issue in the story that 80% of the movie would not exist without, then scroll to my major plot issue.

Now, TFA was a lot like The New Hope. When seeing another big planet killer weapon like the Death Star with the same flaws on it, it was quite a disappointment on level of stupidity, but I still enjoyed the movie overall even if I didn't like everything about it. I had some interest to see what it would be in Episode 8 and to answer the questions TFA emphasized and brought up. Sadly, TLJ (The Last Jedi) failed to bring anything intriguing and the more I saw the less I liked. They stuck with making the beginning like Star Wars Empire Strikes Back. Transport taking off on a planet trying to escape the First Order discovery and hunt down. The last battle at the end was a white planet with very similar Hoth battle set up. They even had a guy taste the ground to tell the audience that it is not snow that it is salt. This movie is a bad Empire Strikes back that is so blatant obvious for anyone watching.

The film really suffers from its plots and subplots. The filming is great, the graphics are good, and they have some really awesome scenes that I can see people looking for eye candy to be entertain by and like it; however, people who actually are story driven and more logical cannot possible like it, ignoring the ""I love Star Wars no matter what"" fanboy/girls.

1. Rey is a Mary Sue. Unfortunately, this point is proven in Episode 8 that the stronger Kylo gets through his hard training to the Dark Side: Rey will also become stronger, yet without any real training. It's the Force that gives her everything. Whatever! I liked Rey in TFA and I had hoped she'd would use a double bladed light saber due to her familiar use of a staff, which would make sense, but I am also a USA Knight fighter and using a light saber, especially a single hand weapon without prior training, is difficult and dangerous. It's not something you get good at overnight or over a few weeks, especially against highly trained and experience fighters. She manages to beat such individuals and this one multiple at the same time.

2. Force Balance... I am not sure this is what the Force Balance implied when it comes to light and dark. This film turns that if there is more Light then there has to be an equal of Dark, so this series now has more problems with this issue. I could write a long time on this subject a lone, but I am going to spar the readers from this, but it is now predictable on where Episode 9 will go and must go to stay true to this new lore.

3. The First Order. This is an issue with both films. The movies failed to give any background on why there is a First Order in the first place, and how it came to power after their main weapon and forces were defeated in TFA. TLJ suddenly starts in chaotic ""Resistance"" being annihilated from existence and the First Order in complete galactic control. WTH happen? Oh, we have to read some visual books to get the story? Thanks Destiny! I mean Disney... Why are all their ships slower than the Resistance? So, a Star Destroyer can chase a smaller episode and board it in a New Hope, yet no First Order ships can catch up to the rebels? Also why is there no shields on their big ships? Dreadnought does not have any shields?

4. Rose... She is a worthless character created for diversity, or let's say modified for it. Now we have some weird love triangles going on here. If it wasn't for Holdo, there would be no place for her. The most hated scene is her preventing Fin from making the ultimate sacrifice to save the people he love and die a hero rather than a fleeing coward. She does this whole stupid speech about ""I saved you"" and ""it is about saving the ones we love"" the exact thing he was trying to due and then the First Order blows up the door to leave them to vulnerable to kill everyone that he was willing to die to save thanks to this woman, and then she is like awkwardly does this force kiss Fin, leaving Fin with this look of you are a dumb bitch look upon his face. It was a huge WTF expression left on his face..

5. Laws are broken. Bombers in this movie apparently apply gravity in space and ignore the vacuum of space.

6. Leah... We can all agree how dumb founded we felt watching that scene of Super Leah!

7. Sidequest - The sidequest of Rose and Fin was the dumbest Harry Potter and PETA forced political scenes in Star Wars history. I prefer to hear about the seductive reasoning of Anakin's hatred of sand again than to watch that scene.

8. Luke... Was it necessary to scar my eyes and kids with the tit milking and drinking? Really? You can't help but be a twisted pervert Disney... Luke is a butchered character. He was willing to help and turn Darth Vader, his father, who had done a lot of bad things and refused to fight or kill him, yet he wanted to murder Ben in his sleep? I am pretty sure they could have found a better explanation because they just make Luke, one the original heroes, into a crazy hypocritical bitter whiner. Terrible! 

9. This movie a gotchya bitch slap you in the face. This whole movie is to try to get you to think one thing and slap you in the face. Holdo is a traitor? NOPE *Slap!* Gonna answer Rey's parent question mirror? NOPE! It's a worthless scene! *SLAP!* Oh, no her parents are worthless nobodies... *SLAP!* Is Phasma gonna be useful in the film? Nope! *Slap!* Remember that Sea Dragon battle with Rey that was planned? Here it is in the background, but it won't be fought... *Slap!* Leah died... NOPE *SLAP!* Luke is here and going to fight Kylo! Nope! Force projection! *SLAP!!!* Rian Johnson: "" I am going Slap Happy!""

10: Little was answered in this film, but the little that was turned out extremely disappointing. The movie created more conflicting questions.

11. Light speed is now a weapon? Okay, why have they not been using it as weapon ever until now to destroy major fleets? You lose more ships and lives in space combat, and it now seems irrelevant on why anyone would want to engage in combat when you can create auto ships to light speed into enemies, including planets. with devastating effectiveness. Who needs Death Stars when you can create a decent size light speed missile?

12. MAJOR Plot flaw for the ENTIRE MOVIE was Holdo. Yes, this film story would never exist if it wasn't for Holdo. Luke would be alive or died in another fashion. There would exist more rebel fighters if it wasn't for her. I literally could not help, but tell my friend, ""HOLD THE DOOR,"" when she was introduce because I thought the guy said Holdor. The stupid purple hair lady of feminist. This movie actually does more harm to feminist if you look at this story plot. How is she such a disaster of a character and harm to feminist? Let's first focus on the commander position. They are engaged in a long turtle race that is only a matter of time before they run out of fuel and get killed. Everyone knows this, and it gets more desperate as time goes and losing ship after ship. People do not want to sit around and wait for their time to die when they have some power of resisting or hope to live. Commander Holdo refused to tell Poe and the crew the plan, likely to make him look like a sexist male figure to show that we should had trusted the female leader, this refusal to inform your crew of a plan, even at gun point, fails to inspire troops and ensure confidence in your command, especially when it was just granted to you in a tragic lost. This is the time to show your worthiness of command and earn the respect of your followers, yet she fails and in that failure she cost more lives. How? She refused to tell Poe that, understandably, lead Poe to take matters into their hands to try to save the Resistance because of incompetent Command,, which was lead for us to believe or think she is a traitor: Poe even states she's a traitor later on to enforce this perception to help those who suspect that to get another bitch slap. Now, we have Fin trying to escape and leave because he actually has a brain to get off this disaster, but he gets stopped by fangirl Rose. These two go to Poe to explain a plan about a disabling the light speed tracker on Snoke's ship, whom didn't even know his ship had such a thing on his own bloody ship and had to have general Huxs point that out. Anyways, this sidequest subplot lead to Fin and Rose getting this 2nd master hacker that they had to settle with by conveniently being in the same jail cell with the guy, who could have walked out any time, but he for some reasoned happened to be in that cell and stayed in there just in time for Fin and Rose to get thrown in. Totally not convenient at all..*Rolls Eyes*. This person leads to betraying the Resistance when they get caught causing more Resistance fighters to be slaughter, the last Hoth battle to occur, and the death of Luke Skywalker. It all happened because Holdo refused to be an actual competent commander and to inspire her forces in desperate times when troops are facing complete destruction by running away waiting for their deaths to occur. If she would have told Poe, this would had all been avoided. They made females like dominant commanders in this film on screen and made them completely incompetent and showed why women should not lead. It is like women leaders have lead the Republic to ruins and destruction. Rey is only good because the Force makes her a Mary Sue of everything, and it has nothing to due with her own hard struggles, will, determination, and skill. She even begs a male figure to quote. ""Show her her place in all this."" Damn! I would think feminist would hate this movie. Phasma was a completely worthless character again. If she returns in the Episode 9, she will be a joke of the Star Wars series: the Kenny of Star Wars, she will be. She is a talented actress and interesting character, but they did not do anything with her in TFA and TLJ, but kill her off quickly and make her look pathetic. 

I did not have major issues with the Prequels or TFA. They all had their good and bad, but this episode kills the future of Star Wars for me and many fans. I will say that I did not like Kylo in TFA, but I did like his character more in this film and Rey less; however, this film is still pretty much trash and terrible story telling. I have seen this film multiple times because of my job, but it gets worse and confirms what I have been thinking on this film since I saw it. I would give it a 4/10 rating. The only thing good about this film are the visual affects and a scene or two. Everything else is dumb, pointless, and violation to my childhood. Star Wars, and story-telling. I may even say this movie made miss Jar Jar Binks. At least he created a long fun hatred of the character, this film leads to a salty end of Star Wars where I no longer care about Episode 9 or anything. In fact, I think they should do a reboot of this series with an actual good story teller and competent writer. I don't need Marvel humor in Star Wars either, especially when it is failed Marvel humor. It is out of place , and it was done so poorly that it became cringey.",1.5, Jonathan D
"December 24, 2017","La película hizo que tuviera sentimientos encontrados, algunas escenas son realmente impactantes, pero hay otras que son aburridas, absurdas e innecesarias. Considero que hay aspectos que no son propios de una película de Star Wars, lo que hicieron con el personaje de Luke Skywalker me parece una burla, parece que el Director Rian Johnson se paso por el arco del triunfo mucho de la cultura Star Wars... Primer película de StarWars que termino por decepcionarme.",2, Mario S

"December 24, 2017","I will start by saying Star Wars the Last Jedi isn't that bad of a movie to deserve a 5.5 but also it is not a movie deserving of a 9 or higher score.

That been said let me start putting the things that i liked first and then i will put the ones i disliked.

LIKES:

*The whole interaction between Kylo Ren and Rey via of a Force bond where she was trying to make him see the good while he was trying to make her join him. It really helped in flesh out both characters.

*Luke conversation with Yoda was really a nice thing. Interesting enough was the fact that Yoda was able to interact with the world either by making a lighting strike the tree or by hiting Luke in the head with his cane.

*The duel between Kylo and Rey against Snoke guards was really good. Amazing coreography.

*Luke's display of Force mastery by the end.

*The little kid using the Force to pull a broom at the end.

DISLIKES

*The MAIN PLOT of the movie is pretty much ridiculous: it is a stupid chase at subluminal speed because the Republic flagship can't hit hiperspace more than once for lack of fuel and because they First Order ships found a way to tail them in FLT flight. 

However WHY not even one of the several First Order ship's captains had the simple idea of making a short hiperspace jump to the position where the fleet trying to slowly run away was?????

* Why didn't Vice Admiral Holdo share her plan to go to the Crait planet while using the Republic flagship as bait to allow escape ships to hid in the planet?

Instead she acts like a huge @sshole demanding blind obedience. 

Sure chastize Poe for acting out of line but at least share with all the Officers and pilots giving their lives for the fight what your plan was. Had she done then perhaps half of said officers and fighters wouldn't had joined a motim against her.

*Luke's death by the end was really stupid, why not finish that scene with just him looking at the Sun? Really unnecessary death, feels like the director was just trying to make some CHEAP shock value.

*Snoke is a joke. All powerfull but can't realize Kylo is actually going to kill him instead of Rey? That feel like a really ""screw you"" directed at JJ Abrams by Riam.

*Really bad explanation to all the foreshadowing Abrams did in SW TFA about Rey's parents. Again ""another screw"" you moment from Riam to JJ Abrams.

All in all STAR WARS THE LAST JEDI is a movie that has it's really good moments amid a lot of fat in the story and really bad resolutions to mysteries from the previous movie.

It deserves a 7.5. A good movie but it could have been a LOT BETTER.",3.5, Francisco Bruno S
"December 24, 2017",Disappointing in terms of story line and character development. Even musical score disappointing. Not inspiring or thrilling or meaningful enough. Luke was lame-not the same Luke. Cheap effects such as the flying Leia. Snoke was chopped in two like a marshmallow-pointless to the story. Not even curious where the story goes after this. Star Wars-please get another director-this was very disappointing.,1, Sarah E
"December 24, 2017",they killed the main bad guy with zero excitement. He just dies. Who was he? Why did he look like a wort? Why was he evil? Tell me something. the movie was a horribly written series of set pieces where plot armor was handed out because actually coming up with ideas are hard and would rather just say oh yeah sudden they can do that,0, ROHAN S
"December 24, 2017","Any herdcore Star Wars fan like me knows that this movie is not accurate to what should have happend. Luke Skywalker is the most powerful Jedi of all time, this is somthing George Lucas (the creator) has said himself. Though some of his powers were showcased in the end they failed to show his immense power. Every scene in the casino was painful. At least 20 minutes of those scenes could have been deleted, it was boring because it felt like I was waisting time untill the climax would happen. Mark Hamil has been very open to how he does not like his role he has said how luke is a Jedi, he wouldn't give up, he run away he would stay as a Jedi would. This in my opinion is a huge problem and downfall to this new trilogy. With all the buzz around supreme leader snoak I was surprised when they decided to kill him. With so manny fans trying to figure out his origin they just killed him. In conclusion this movies poor writing fails to deliver good character arcs for our original characters such as Luke and Leia. Snoak was an underused character as well. Poor directing by Ryan Johnson, bad writing set this movie up for failure.",0, 
"December 24, 2017","Such waste potential. Rian Johnson has trashed Abram's vision for this trilogy and has left episode IX in shambles that could possibly ruin the franchises future. 

Filled with an unecessary side story, plot holes, wrong Luke Skywalker, discarding of important character backstory, and no questions answered and just more piled on.

Hopefully Abrams can save this trilogy in episode IX from its doom.",0.5, Garrett R
"December 24, 2017","This movie was a steaming hot mess. The character of Luke Skywalker is completely incongruent with what we saw from the previous episodes and the latest treatment is completely disrespectful. 

The Rose character feels like it was jammed in the story to score some cheap brownie points with Asian and female audiences and is not intergral to the main story. 

There is so much more wrong with the movie but would require spoilers. There is a special place in hell for Rian Johnson for sabotaging this franchise. The downturn in the opening week figures speaks for itself and no amount of Disney promotion is going to mask to stink.",0.5, 
"December 24, 2017","Depending on what one values most in a Star Wars movie, this could be among the better films or among the worst in the saga for the bold choices it frequently makes that infrequently pay off and sometimes get stepped on by excessive hammed-up comedy.

"December 24, 2017","Some looking visuals but horrible movie overall. I'm a huge star wars fan but this was dreadful. Zero tension, zero heart, no substance, ill-timed humour.

"December 24, 2017","Star wars: the last jedi review

I have been going to this special bakery since I was a child, they make new cakes every few years. They are delicious! I can still remember the first cake I ate there, it was so good! I think the second one was even better. They are always a bit different but they use the same main ingredients in all of them. 

Anyway I hadn't been there in a while and two years ago I went to the special bakery to try their new cake. I thought it was good, it had those same ingredients I love. When i finished eating my cake the baker said to me , come back in two years ill have a new cake you are going to love! I'll put some chocolate bits, caramel bits and a few surprises in there. 

I left the special bakery thinking mmm I can't wait for this new cake.

Last week I go to my special bakery to try the new cake, everybody was talking about it. I just couldn't wait.

The baker brings the cake, it looks amazing! One of the most beautiful cake I have ever seen! Then I cut a slice and I find out that the chocolate bits and caramel bits that the baker promised are not in there !? I try a bite and at first it tasted ok but then I realized that the main ingredients that I loved from these cakes since I was a child were missing!?

I remember thinking, well I'll give it a try anyway, I'm always up for something new !

I continue eating my cake and find some gummy bears in there, the sour kind! It doesn't really go in there! I have a bad feeling about this, but I eat it all anyway.

I left the special bakery and remember thinking that I was feeling very unsatisfied by this new cake. It had none of the ingredients I loved and new ones that really didn't like.

As soon as I got home I started to feel sick, I think it had salmonella in it because I've had diarrhea since. 

I am not going to eat anymore of this cake that's for sure and I even wonder if I'll return to the special bakery. I think I'll wait and see if people get sick first before I try the new cake in two years.",0.5, Pierre L
"December 24, 2017","Very overrated with bad plot twists and lines. It tried to appeal to too many audiences, which fails all of them. Since it's a Star Wars movie you need to see it, but wait until Netflix. I wanted my $$ back. Only Jaja could have made it worse.",2, Richard%20 T
"December 24, 2017","Without a doubt my least favorite non prequel starwars. The comedic moments timed very poorly and usually had the effect of removing the tension from what should be a serious scene. I don't mind the direction the story takes, I just hate how it gets there.",2, T B
"December 24, 2017","Very disappoint in this film, here why:

1. Luke is totally unrecognizable in this film. We are suppos to believe that man who face down Darth Vader with nothing more than faith, loses that faith when facing his teenage nephew ??

2. Finn's whole storyline sucks, what was the was the point. Rose and him didn't do anything to save the fleet. Then in a bout of courage he defeats the super stormtrooper.

3. AR2 and C3PO, where are they? if someone were to watch this film without any knowledge of the Star Wars storyline they wouldn't think these guys were important at all. They are almost nonexistent in the film. They use to have their own storylines in films past. 

Overall, the film is a big let down!!",2.5, Pdog I

Wastes a significant amount of time on sub plots that don't advance the plot of the movie. Adds a few new special effects, that are totally un-necessary, ie Laser shots that fire on an arc and bombers that actually ""drop"" bombs in space.

"December 24, 2017","*Possible Spoilers BEWARE*

We're finally here, the sequel to Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the Empire Strikes Back of this new trilogy, the film that was supposed to be so dark and so different and so good that it gave the director Rian Johnson a whole trilogy to his own. Does it deliver? I'm sad to say, that as of Christmas Eve of 2017, after a good few days of thought and discussion, I cannot say it delivers. The one word I can use to describe it is just, disappointing. 

Let me start off by saying that this is not a bad film so to speak, it is beautifully shot, has a recognizable score, great acting, and some amazing action sequences. However, past that, when it comes to the actual story and how it progresses the Star Wars lore, I don't think the film delivers in anyway.

The Force Awakens set up so many aspects of this new trilogy that were supposedly going to be answered or explored deeper in this film. Who are Rey's parents? Who is Snoke? What has Luke been doing this whole time? And so many more questions were established and built up in The Force Awakens only to be thrown out or shut down or just laid to rest in an extremely boring way in this film. The answer to the questions about Snoke are just thrown out as none of them are answered at all, the question about Rey's parents is explained but in such a boring way and a confusing way that it honestly doesn't make a whole lot of sense. The entire character of Luke, which I honestly was mostly okay with, was changed around and twisted. The movie had huge twists and turns, some landed perfectly while some missed the mark for me. As a Star Wars fan, I just can't sit back and accept some of the answers and some of the events in the film as they transpire. I can't just accept that Luke went to that distant island to die, I can't just accept that we never see him do anything of significance in the film besides die, I can't just accept that Snoke is gone and we will never learn about him even though just before his death he was flinging Rey around like a ragdoll while barely moving his finger. The film was inconsistent with lore, it dropped so much of the lore into the trash, and it just felt so unsatisfying that, as a huge fan of the series I can't give it a 5 star rating. These opinions may change as time goes on, as I watch the film over and over, and as Episode 9 rolls around, but as it stands today, I have to rate this film near the bottom of the totem pole.",3, Ashton L

Rian Johnson accomplished something that neither Darth Vader nor Emperor Palpatine could. He killed Luke. Not only did he kill Luke, but he utterly disgraced him and turned him into a nearly detestable character. Yoda laughs at Luke after he is fooled by Rey who has stolen his books. He needlessly dies a defeated coward and a fool, responsible for the greatest tragedy depicted in the Star Wars film universe: The destruction of several planets and the end of the Republic he once fought to save.

"December 24, 2017","I was shocked when I found out how many good reviews this movie had received. I've read plenty, and still fail to get their point.

Sure, the director did show courage and made up for most of J. J. Abrams' mistakes. You really can't blame Johnson for winking at SW fans (although he did wink at children), and in spite of many ideas taken from Episode V and VI or other SW movies, I must admit that Episode VIII is indeed an original, mostly new movie (whereas The Force Awakens wasn't, in my opinion).

Still, the whole film's filled with... plain nonsense. Silly x-wings demolishing star destroyers cannons, bombs falling in outer space, Leia surviving explosions and flying through outer space (worst moment in the whole saga), people becoming stronger than jedi masters without training and so much more. I realise that consistency is not what Star Wars is made of, and I wouldn't be indignated for a few ridicolous scenes, but there are so many it's impossible to withstand them.

I also hated the continuous bad jokes and puns, the almighty rolling robot (he is cute, but gosh, he basically saves the day every other scene) and the low level humour which differs from the light hearted one of the other SW movies.

I wasn't convinced by Luke's transformation either, and was disappointed at Snoke being a simple placeholder (that's mostly on Ep VII though).

I didn't get why nobody in the high ranks of the Resistance could come up with an explanation of how they had been tracked by the First Order, while Rose and Finn figured it out in a few seconds. Nor it was clear to me while Holdo didn't simply explain her plan to Dameron, at least AFTER his mutiny (I call nonsense).

The whole casino scene was boring and it didn't feel very Star Wars-y to me, and surely was too long. It felt unnecessary, as did Del Toro's character whose name I can't remember.",1.5, Matteo C
"December 24, 2017","Disappointed doesn't begin to cover it. This is a disgusting blot on one of my favorite movie series of all time. I can't believe Kennedy allowed Johnson to vomit all over such an iconic series, she should be ashamed of herself. From the very first minute I thought ""I have a bad feeling about this."" which proved to be right on the money. I'm disgusted at the way Luke and Leia's characters are denigrated and abused. Two of the most wonderful roles in movie history, they don't have a single worthwhile word or deed in the entire movie. For the first time ever watching a Star Wars movie, I was bored and disgusted. I hear JJ Abrams is coming back to do IX and if he manages to resurrect the dignity and excitement of Star Wars, I'll consider him one of the great writer/directors of all time.

"December 24, 2017","Rian Johnson has succeeded in one major respect . .. He has succeeded in making The Phantom Menace and Attack of Clones look like Citizen Kane in comparison to The Last Jedi. There is simply no excuse for what he has done to this franchise. Clearly the man hates Star Wars. Did Star Wars do something to Rian Johnson to deserve this treatment? Did it laugh at him during gym class at film school? Did it ditch him at senior prom and spend the rest of the evening dancing with Kevin Smith? There must be some rationale behind this epic crap-fest of a movie. 

 It's as though Rian Johnson had tawdry, unprotected movie sex with several Michael Bay movies, primarily Transformers, and was infected with cinematic herpes which he has now passed onto my beloved Star Wars. Sadly, there's no amount of cinematic Valtrex to stop the constant burning and irritation I feel from this movie. It's made me begin to question the existence of a benevolent deity, for why would a merciful God allow the total destruction of a franchise by allowing Rian Johnson anywhere near Star Wars? 

I know this film has caused a major rift among Star Wars fans. Some of the reviews on this website laud it as the greatest Star Wars movie ever. I want to reach out to these good folks, and let them know that there are good, capable and caring optometrists out there who can treat the sever vision problems that, based on their glowing reviews, clearly afflict them. I would also reach out to Kathleen Kennedy and plead with her, to give Rian Johnson something to do other than being involved with the Star Wars franchise. I'm sure he would be a brilliant foot rest for her, or maybe hand out clean towels in Lucasfilm restrooms. If he must write and direct, let Disney acquire the rights to Gigli and do a reboot of THAT movie. Bottom line, there's plenty of things he can do other than continue to destroy the Star Wars universe. I'm betting North Korea needs a terrible writer/director of his caliber.",0.5, Rick E

"December 24, 2017","I grew up loving Star Wars. It was the epitome of my youth and for my generation(Gen Y), seeing Star Wars continue was a dream come true... until The Last Jedi. As a whole this was a decent movie; however there are too many holes, problems, and inconsistencies for this to be a movie worthy of the title ""Part of the Star Wars Franchise"".

**THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS************************

Let's start with the good:

We saw Yoda. They used their lightsabers, and we saw some cool use oft he Jedi skills.

Now for the bad:

1) Luke's character. Luke, as was created and written in the original franchise, would NEVER try to kill his nephew because he SENSED the dark in him?!?! Not true to the character.

2) Snoke was killed as if it was a minor thing. Snoke was the bad guy, the villain, and he was killed that easy???? Sorry but no. It was a ""quick fix"" to get rid of him without dealing with him.

3) Kylo Ren, aka Ben Solo, turned evil BECAUSE HIS UNCLE TRIED TO KILL HIM????????? REALLY?!?!?! I'm not buying that. Another cop out to avoid having to include a backstory or the prequel to this one.

4) The general who replaces Leia decides to abandon ship for no reason whatsoever, and doesn't inform her crew? That's just weak leadership. AND they cut way too many of her scenes. They didn't show this character accurately.

5) This was meant to be the darkest film of the trilogy, and they turned it into a ""happy, happy, everything's great"" BABY FILM! The darkest film was no longer the darkest film. It turned into a ""happy sunshine"" everything's great, let's show how teamwork is wonderful lame and BULL.........

6) Kylo ""knows"" who Rey's parents are? Really? Someone with that much force is a freakin' nobody??!?!?!?!?!

7) The CUT scenes. They cut so much out, that they ruined the movie! There was supposed to be a scene that explains the tree Luke burns down, but because the legend he tells that explains said tree, was ""too religious"" they cut it. Seriously, a legend of light and dark was ""Too religious""? Get a grip.

8) This movie breaks way too much canon. 

9) The ""I'm saving you"" chick. REALLY!?! HE WAS SAVING THE ENTIRE REBELLION! She was a useless character. USELESS.

Overall, this movie needs to be stricken from the records and rereleased with the cut scenes added back in.",2, Teresa L

"December 24, 2017","A beautiful but horrible movie. Poor storytelling, huge plot holes, its lack of continuity and simple common sense undercut the movie from start to finish. The movie resolves almost all of the mysteries and questions from the TFA in unsatisfying ways, usually with mundane and boring results. What is worse is the treatment of the Luke Skywalker character, who SW fans have waited four near 35 years to see on screen again , to be relegated to a shell of the character, who violates everything fans had come to love about him. The humor was better suited to a parody of SW, it took you out of the film and violated the most important law of SCI FI it made it ""cheesy"". The movie also undercuts the new trilogy's villains, is anyone afraid of Hux, the First Order or Ren - no. They made them into buffoons, keystone cops or worse. Snoke briefly demonstrates he had the potential to be a great villain, one that everyone should fear before being discarded like most of the TFA plots and without any satisfying backstory or explanation. We are left with a angry petulant child REN with daddy issue who proves he is the prequel's Anakin Skywalker's direct decedent. The lack of follow-through on key character moments is in excusable. Luke finds out Ren killed his best friend Han and we get ""nothing"" no reaction no character moments, - simply criminal. The plot revolves around a slow motion ""chase"" that makes no sense and simply breakdown all that we know about the world Lucas created. The side plot to the B-movie casino was horrible, had no impact on the story, looked terrible and was overall pointless. The expectations for this movie was sky high, after Disney made a ""decent"" movie with TFA and a great SW movie with Rogue One (because it respected the source material). That combined with the real return of one of the most beloved characters in film history Luke Skywalker enabled this movie to have a huge opening. Now that fans have seen it, they are rebelling and calling for the director's and Kathleen Kennedy's firing and the film's removal from canon. As a business decision, how could Disney and LF decide to release a film that completely undercuts not only the TFA, but the entire franchise. The movie is basically a slap in the face to SW fans. Horrible. What is said is SW wanted this to be great, we had hope Disney had righted the ship after the prequels. What we got was insulting.",0.5, H M
"December 24, 2017","Its a solid movie. Regardless, of how busy it is, I still left the theatre satisfied. People are upset because their personal fan theory proved wrong, and some people just like to complain. Especially, if it's the trendy thing to do.",4, Tony S
"December 24, 2017","I was shocked when I found out how many good reviews this movie had received. I've read plenty, and still fail to get their point.

Sure, the director did show courage and made up for most of J. J. Abrams' mistakes. You really can't blame Johnson for winking at SW fans (although he did wink at children), and in spite of many ideas taken from Episode V and VI or other SW movies, I must admit that Episode VIII is indeed an original, mostly new movie (whereas The Force Awakens wasn't, in my opinion).

Still, the whole film's filled with... plain nonsense. Silly x-wings demolishing star destroyers cannons, bombs falling in outer space, Leia surviving explosions and flying through outer space (worst moment in the whole saga), people becoming stronger than jedi masters without training and so much more. I realise that consistency is not what Star Wars is made of, and I wouldn't be indignated for a few ridicolous scenes, but there are so many it's impossible to withstand them.

I also hated the continuous bad jokes and puns, the almighty rolling robot (he is cute, but gosh, he basically saves the day every other scene) and the low level humour which differs from the light hearted one of the other SW movies.

I wasn't convinced by Luke's transformation either, and was disappointed at Snoke being a simple placeholder (that's mostly on Ep VII though).

I didn't get why nobody in the high ranks of the Resistance could come up with an explanation of how they had been tracked by the First Order, while Rose and Finn figured it out in a few seconds. Nor it was clear to me while Holdo didn't simply explain her plan to Dameron, at least AFTER his mutiny (I call nonsense).

The whole casino scene was boring and it didn't feel very Star Wars-y to me, and surely was too long. It felt unnecessary, as did Del Toro's character whose name I can't remember.",1.5, Matteo C
"December 24, 2017","Disappointed doesn't begin to cover it. This is a disgusting blot on one of my favorite movie series of all time. I can't believe Kennedy allowed Johnson to vomit all over such an iconic series, she should be ashamed of herself. From the very first minute I thought ""I have a bad feeling about this."" which proved to be right on the money. I'm disgusted at the way Luke and Leia's characters are denigrated and abused. Two of the most wonderful roles in movie history, they don't have a single worthwhile word or deed in the entire movie. For the first time ever watching a Star Wars movie, I was bored and disgusted. I hear JJ Abrams is coming back to do IX and if he manages to resurrect the dignity and excitement of Star Wars, I'll consider him one of the great writer/directors of all time. He's surely got his work cut out for him.",0.5, Mick G

"December 24, 2017","Rian Johnson has succeeded in one major respect . .. He has succeeded in making The Phantom Menace and Attack of Clones look like Citizen Kane in comparison to The Last Jedi. There is simply no excuse for what he has done to this franchise. Clearly the man hates Star Wars. Did Star Wars do something to Rian Johnson to deserve this treatment?

"December 24, 2017","An extremely disappointing middle chapter in the new Star Wars trilogy. The plot was boring and nonsensical, and felt obligatory at parts such as the final battle scene. New characters were unnecessary and only served to distract from what could have been a truly epic return for Luke Skywalker and a passing of the mantle to a younger generation of heroes. The Last Jedi sets an uneven, confusing emotional tone that reaches ridiculous levels at times. Despite the movie constantly needing to remind you that the rebels are at their lowest point and to hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, the unnecessary humor and shenanigans actively work against this dark, emotional attitude. Fans expecting a dark middle chapter for our heroes to overcome against all odds in the final installment, full of bombshell revelations and exciting fights against powerful foes, will be sorely disappointed. Despite multiple opportunities during the plot in which to redeem itself, the movie instead doubled-down on predictable, obligatory outcomes and never came close to living up to the excitement and promise generated by the trailers. All this being said, I do see the possibility of an important foundation being laid in this movie that could culminate into at least one major bombshell in the final movie.

This is a Disneyfied story with CGI cows and cute, cuddly and useless graphics. The humor was forced, over used and predictable. Suddenly Leia is a super hero flying through the vacuum of space. She had never been this strong with the force until now. If she was this strong with the force then Snoke should have been crushed by the wonder twins Luke & Leia long ago.

All characters are underdeveloped and quick shots of amulets are supposed to be the only background information we need to understand a character. Fin, Rose and Captain Phasma must have force, too. They are all hit by a blast and survive but the Stormtroopers around them are all dead.

Kylo Ren (emo Venom) and Rey (Merry Jane Watson) try to show an emotional connection but neither will yield and become a power couple. Preserving Star Wars IX. Completely Disney now with the corporation leveraging the theaters and taking a larger cut like the Master Codebreaker.

That said, it's a difficult movie. It's long, a lot goes on, the plot is stressful, but this is all in service of the most thematically rich Star Wars ever, one that zeroes in on what made the 1977 origin tick: that it was a story about a nobody (Luke) who by chance finds himself thrust into a conflict bigger than himself and who must learn to put his idealism to use in the service of others. The Last Jedi doubles down in this premise--it's a movie about the nobodies matter, a movie about how the people who move history are not just knights, lords, and politicians, but everyday people grappling with a complicated moral universe. It's a masterpiece in it's own right and a true return to form for the franchise.",5, Kyle M

"December 24, 2017","SPOILERS, obviously.

The prophecy was always that Anakin would restore balance to the Force. Turns out he did that by becoming a Sith Lord and cancelling out the Sith with the Jedi using the power of familial ties.Which leaves Star Wars with a ""balanced"" Force which now spontaneously creates supervillains and their ""balanced"" superheroes from nowhere, no specialized Sith or Jedi training required. In fact, such relics as mentorship, training, learning curve, maturation, and dues paying are all summarily dismissed and their symbols and canon literature literally burned to ashes. On both sides. Perhaps we have here a relic of the now-discredited educational ""gifted kids program"" disaster of the 80s and 90s. Who needs to pay dues and learn the ropes by intense structured practice and guidance when you are the natural born prodigy who can summon powers at will? If you feel like this picture was telling you that you belong to an obsolete fandom for which the future has no use, except maybe as the ATM from which your kids will draw their Star Wars theme park admission charge, you are not alone. Several scenes provide apt metaphors for the real world phenomena of Last Jedi. Hamill's visible disgust at the blue milk is very like his public comments on the process - he was disgusted, but he had to suck it down anyway. The 16-hour taligating-in-space pursuit, ending in a maneuver which invalidates the entire franchise premise of space combat looks remarkably like the reports of the writing process - it followed the canon through a meandering course of conflicted maneuvers only to blow it all up for lack of a better idea. Luke's gesture of flicking a dust mote from his shoulder after the ATAT blast-fest is emblematic of the relative status of the old characters to the relative impotence and diminished interest of the new ones. Perhaps Mr. Johnson believed he was paying homage to Luke's master status, but such a display of power from Luke also reveals the absence of any reason to be intimidated, or even interested in Kylo. The evil once represented by one of the most compelling screen villains of all time may now be whisked away by a flick of the fingers. As may future installments of this soap opera in space, a far cry from the space opera Lucas invented.",2, Jan T

The Good:

- CG is good (better be it's 2017) Light speed blow up of an unnecessary character was cool.

- The ending is tolerable... 

- JJ Abrams is directing episode 9! (what a mess to clean up)

The Bad:

- Too many Forced Jokes (No pun intended)

- Rey is a ""nobody""??? 

- A movie for Critics, Rian Johnson and casual customers...

- Horses??? Did I pay to see ""Black beauty"" or Star Wars??? Don't answer that. 

- Vegas Casino??? I thought this was a ""galaxy far far away..""??

The Ugly:

- Lea ""Poppins""??? huh?? Lea floats in the ship but nothing floats out? Interesting... and who taught her how to keep warm and hold her breath in space???

- Snoke couldn't see Kylo's hand turning on the light saber?? He couldn't see that coming?? Really?? (That better have been just a hologram of Snoke..)

- Luke got his butt kicked by Rey... and she's a ""nobody""?

- I guess ""training"" means using simple words and sentences like ""just breathe.."" wow, could someone ""train"" Rian Johnson to ""just leave..."" the Star wars universe?? Ha!

Snoke was pointless and turns out not to be a major character at all. For someone so strong, he was sure killed easily and in a pathetic way. 

Rey is nobody....

Luke is a coward who then dies because he used the force. 

Han and Luke are dead. Carrie Fisher RIP can't be in the next movie. There's the 3 big heros gone.

Forced an inappropriately timed humor. 

Dumb script

Horrible plot 

Chewy had 1 minute of screen time

Still unoriginal/ similar plot to episode 5 just like force awakens had an almost identical plot to a new hope 

Finn could have sacrificed himself to save to rebel base but that dumb girl rose stopped him, ruining a possibility of a good plot point and a beautiful sacrifice for three greater good. 

How did phasma get off starkiller base, is sheer really dead this time? 

How did Kylo get off starkiller base

Kylo kills his master then wants Rey to join him. Go find an original idea!

Leia surviving in space and force pulling herself into the ship was stupid. Sure she is force sensitive but had never demonstrated any true force abilities but all the sudden is super strong in the force. 

The whole plot would have been different had leia's replacement commander just told poe the plan. Their inability to communicate caused every issue they encountered

Good CGI and good acting leads to a good movie, and this was no exception. But it certainly wasn't the best. I almost feel as though too much happened, and I am not sure where they will go and what they will do, but I guess they want viewers to not know what will happen next. Problem I felt it had was that it had two major storylines going on at once. Usually a film has one major and one smaller storyline. This left me almost overwhelmed, as the movie made me do all kinds of thinking, which other films wouldn't make me do as much of.

"December 24, 2017","I'm not going to go into great detail on this movie, suffice it to say, it was bad. 

The problem with modern Star Wars is cultural infiltration. in 1977, George Lucas introduced us to a universe we had never seen before, never even imagined, and we loved it. For a moment, we forgot our politics, our biases, our gender issues...we just let ourselves escape to that place ""in a galaxy far far away"". Essentially, what we were presented with was a window, a window into a fantasyland.

Fast forward to the 21st century and all you have today is a mirror. So instead of showing us something different and unbelievable, we get political commentary, racial balancing, ethics lessons, animal rights issues...with some rather mediocre special effects If I may say. Disney is trying too hard to please everyone, and when you do that, you end up disappointing everyone. 

And where the hell is Steven Spielberg? of all the directors who could make a great Star Wars movie, isn't HE #1? so why the heck is JJ Abrams directing ANOTHER one?

"December 24, 2017","It is the worse movie I have watched in 2017. I will factually say why is it bad. I have watched it twice, I was very disappointed when I watched the first time. I thought it was just me. Because the critic review has rated very highly and raved about this movie. I cringed while I watched the second time. It was much much worst then I remembered. To start off if... Star Wars happens in a galaxy far far away then most of the physics and chemistry should be very similar in this part of the universe, right? I think its okie to get some of the physics wrong, I can look past it, but every act and sub act has god defying moments. That's just very lazy on the director and story writer part. Nobody bother to check through. Act 1 if bombing bay open in SPACE, shouldn't the crew get sucked out of space? PHYSICS FAIL. Also, If Leia gets blown into SPACE, and she SUPERMAN her way back to the ship and opens the door, shouldn't Leia and the crew get suck/blown into space? Act 2, Kaylo and Rey communicated with each other thru the vastness of space using the force, how is it that while they were communicating, Rey got wet because the raining and wet climate on the island but Kaylo got wet too (just because Rey got wet due to the island's weather, it does not mean Kaylo should get wet too, just because they communicated thru the force, they now can physically transport matter thru space and time instantaneously??? Doesn't make sense), even thou Kaylo was in Space? The story line was so so messy, and many parts of the story don't make sense. In the RETURN OF THE JEDI, the rebels won. so how is it that in this episode we are only left with 400 rebels. YES! IN THE ENTIRE GALAXY, WE HAVE LESS THAN 400 REBELS? WTF happened in between the 40 years? After Leia was blown into space and after she SUPERMAN her way back to the ship and conveniently opened a door in space to let herself in, she was too hurt to lead. This purple hair lady took over command. She had a plan to save the remaining rebels but refuse to share the plans with the Star Fighter pilot POE even after he asked. It doesn't make sense. In this kind of do or die situation everybody needs to know their job, if you are the leader, you need to spell out the plan and not sit one corner and scheme. Especially when everybody's lives are at stake. Bad character with bad character decision that serves no purpose in the movie at all. I want to talk about ROSE FINN and CODE BREAKER GUY. Why the CODE BREAKER GUY ONLY ESCAPE from jail after ROSE and FINN goes into the same cell.... BEATS ME. This part is so so bad... I don't want to go into details. Else I will go on forever. LET'S GO INTO THE MEAT OF THIS REVIEW. THIS IS A STAR WARS MOVIE. TO BE A JEDI. YOU NEED TO FIRST HAVE THE APTITUDE then you train until you lost an arm a leg or a master. even then, you are still at best half filled. You need to walk the same journey as all LIGHT SIDE FORCE PRACTITIONER. you need to be defeated, humbled but never give up and still grow and continue to serve the mission. THIS IS STAR WARS. HOW THE HELL, THIS REY GODDESS BE MORE POWERFUL THAN LUKE IN A FORCE FIGHT AND A WEAPON FIGHT? HOW? HOW IS IT SHE CAN PILOT THE MILLENIUM FALCON BETTER THAN HAN AND CHEWIE.... ON HER FIRST TRY???????? HOW CAN SHE BEAT KAYLO IN A FIGHT when she first used a lightsabre?? HOW CAN?? SHE HAVE NEVER TRAINED UNDER A MASTER FOR ANY PERIOD OF TIME, SHE IS THE BEST PILOT IN ANY FIGHTER SHE SITS, SHE BEST LUKE KAYLO IN A LIGHT SABRE DUEL. SHE CAN DO JEDI MInD TRICK WITHOUT SEEING IT FROM ANYBODY? LUKE DOEST KNOW WHERE SHE COMES FROM. SHE IS JUST POWERFUL. FOR THE SAKE OF BEING POWERFUL. THATs NOT STORY TELLING. THAT SOME INCOHERENT STORY written by an 8 year old. The jokes are BAD. THeY ARE REALLY REALLY BAD. NO TWO LIGHT SABRE EVER TOUCHED EACH OTHER IN THE ENTIRE LONGEST STAR WARS MOVIE. CHARACTERS POP IN AND OUT FOR NO GOOD REASONs OTHER THAN TO SELL MORE MERCHANDISE. THE DARK SIDE ARE SO OVERWHELMINGLY POWERFUL but still lost. THEY LOST not because of CUNNING TACTICS by the rebels. they lost because of some really really stupid reasons. Things materialize in and out of the movie. I AM TALKING TO YOU, LUCKY DICE. THIS MOVIE, IS POORLY REWRITTEN, POORLY EXECUTED, it's like watching 4 different mini clips but was sold under the pretence that it was a complete movie. ALSO, HOW CAN THE CRITIC GIVE 92 POINTS, UNLESS DISNEY HAS THREATENED YOU OR HINT OF ECONOMIC INCENTIVE OR LACK THERE-OFF ELSE THIS IS A HIGHLY INCOHERENT MOVIE at best DESERVES 50 for its VISUALS. BUT MOVIES IS ABOUT ITS STORY... THE STORY IS TOTALLY INCOHERENT AS A STAND ALONE OR AS A CONTINUATION. THE CHARACTERS DONT BEHAVE LIKE HEROES OR VILLIANS. THEY BEHAVE LIKE SOME IMMATURE JUVENILLES. THE CRITICS ARE NOT HONEST. DISNEY IS CORRUPT. I want to give it a negative score, but 1/2 is as low as I can give. RIAN is just dumb. A universe that has established physics and character and all the more mundane and difficult part all done for you. All you need to do now is just tell a story. Even that you messed it up. YOU SUCK. TALENTLESS.",0.5, opszelda o

"December 24, 2017","Really some people thinks this is a Star Wars movie?

The original Story is about the Skywalkers, if you want to Watch a movie about pass the torch to a new generation, this is your chance but if you love the original Star Wars Characters avoid this mess",2, Miguel G
"December 24, 2017","I do not think that this film was poorly directed or made, the special effects, the camera work etc were all great. However the story, the plot holes, the SJW bullshit and the assassination of Luke Skywalker completely ruined it for me. Without going into too much detail this is what pissed me off:

- Luke throwing away this Father's lightsabre

- Luke and the titty milk

- Rebel Bombers LITERALLY dropping bombs... in space.

- One X-Wing taking on a Dreadnaught

- The entire casino subplot

- Rey beating Luke in a duel

- Luke thinking about murdering an unarmed child after everything he did to save his Father in the original trilogy

- Laura Dern not just telling everyone (including Poe) her plan

- The Hyperspeed Ramming Scene

- Leia flying through the air like Superman

- The retarded Astral Projection plot line

- Rose saving Finn from destroying the space-ram, literally making his character even more placeholder / useless

The sad thing is, there's probably more. Thanks for ruining my childhood Disney.",0.5, Jason B

"December 24, 2017","It feels as if Rian Johnson has forgotten that the Star Wars films are a trilogy, not a two film thing. The plot was rapidly paced and jumped parts quicker than a bad action movie, with parts from TFA that don't seem to add up.",1.5, Jon C
"December 24, 2017","TLDR: This movie is safe, forgettable, and entirely unoriginal.

I have seen it twice. I recognize that Rian Johnson had a difficult task, and lots of people were expecting TLJ to meet the standard set by ESB. I was not. However, I was also not looking for a movie that rehashed every plot point in ESB and ROTJ (to the point of parroting back dialogue), without even developing the new heroes we had come to love from TFA. As a female fan, I was excited to see the vulnerable, nuanced character of Rey in TFA, and spent the last two years defending her from ""she's just a Mary Sue"" detractors. Well, bad news, in this movie she actually is a Mary Sue. (Speaking of Mary Sues, when did Finn learn how to fly? A major plot point in TFA revolves around the fact that he can't, and now he can just hop in a cockpit and all's well?)

At its heart, TLJ doesn't want to be a Star Wars movie, but it fails to take us in a new direction, or any direction. The plot and characters are stuck in place (literally). Prolific jump cuts make it impossible to build any tension and effectively diffuse what little there is. John Williams' score is actually tiring and tonally out of place with what is on screen. The short shots allow no time to develop musical themes, so we're basically reduced to ""Is Rey on-screen? Rey's theme is playing."" ""Is Luke on-screen? Force theme."" ""The Resistance? March of The Resistance 1000x!!"" The soundtrack is like dessert all the time, and leaves you feeling sick.

My dislike of TLJ does not stem from being a butt-hurt fan with wish fulfillment issues. The few things lauded as gutsy in TLJ were actually telegraphed in TFA and I was on board with them. A particular aspect of Luke's past did not sit well with a number of people, but I was pleasantly surprised and felt that it worked. I won't say that TLJ was good just because it touched on a couple of interesting things that were teed up for it. This movie has almost none of the threads from TFA, none of the heart of ESB or ANH, and none of the mythos that underscores the whole franchise. It's just a poorly edited, hollow exercise in irreverent predictability.",1.5, R B
"December 24, 2017","I was looking forward to this movie all year! Not only was it awful, but it retroactively makes Force Awakens bad. The way Johnson, Kennedy, and Lucasfilm are treating it's core fanbase is unbelievably dumb founding. This franchise died with Luke.",1, Justin O
"December 24, 2017","great visual movie, but plot made no sense. Luke skywalkers legacy is destroyed in this movie. For true fans, its a slap in the face. For new fans who watched the force awakens its a slap in the face. Nothing from the first movie is answered, and there are too many gotcha moments that make it seem like the director is deliberately alienating fans, and what jj abrams did in tfa. I have no problem moving on to new characters, and breaking ties with the original trilogies, but that cant happen as the middle story in a new trilogy based on the originals. At the end of episode 9, and then the new trilogy is the place for that. Very disppointing overall. I will not watch or support any further star wars movies, like Luke said in ROTJ, my movies are truly dead.",0.5, 
"December 24, 2017","Like many others I'm disappointed in how Disney and non George Lucas handled Star Wars since it was purchased. I am not a Episode VII or VIII fan. Both movies make no sense and that's coming from the Star Wars universe. It doesn't have the same feel as the movies that came before it. Episode I, II, and III feel like they are in the SW universe. SW didn't have to be rejuvenated. The reason it's been making so much money is because it's STAR WARS and the original trio was attached to the film. It was guaranteed. I wish they stayed true to what came before.

Mark my words..people will say the prequels are better then the sequels in the future.

That being said...Rogue One is an amazing movie. At least it had good flow.",0.5, Jeremy M

"December 24, 2017","I created an account just to review this movie here. I am a fan of Star Wars, and of movies in general. I see everything and have for the past 25 years. I feel on this movie the critics did the audience a huge disservice, This movie was terrible. Did it have some entertaining sequences? Sure. But it was like Rian Johnson wanted to go a completely different direction than what was set up for this in TFA. I thought JJ Abrams, despite a lot of copying from the OT, set up the new trilogy with some compelling storylines and characters. It's almost as if Rian Johnson was not happy being boxed in by any of it and just threw most of it in the garbage. To be clear, and because a lot of the other criticism of this film relates to this, I have no problem with any social points being made in films, I have no problem with the diversity of the cast (I think that's great), and having lots of strong women characters (I think that's fantastic as well). My criticism is with the terrible story, spending way too much time on a subplot that amounts to nothing in the end, introducing additional characters that add nothing to the plot, and being inconsistent with the Star Wars universe as a whole, and the hooks we the audience were left with at the end of TFA. Additionally, while the visuals were amazing at times, it did not FEEL like a Star Wars movie. Bad jokes in very odd places seemed like an intentional slap in the face to longtime fans. The cutting between the various subplots seemed forced. And at to that, there were very few wipe transitions. While I wasn't counting, it seemed very clear that a decision was made to not use many wipe transitions. The wipe transitions really define the visual style in all the Star Wars films. I understand that they didn't use any in Rogue One, and at the time I thought it was an intentional stylistic decision to make it appear separate from the man saga (along with the non-Williams Score). Anyhow, I saw the movie twice, and on second viewing most of my criticisms of this movie were confirmed....at first I thought perhaps I was missing something. I have zero desire to watch Episode IX, this movie has ruined Star Wars for me. They have ruined Luke Skywalker, I can see why Mark Hamill was so adamantly opposed to this portrayal. I feel sorry for him, but to his credit he still committed and gave it his best and I thought his performance was fantastic.",0.5, Marcel P
"December 24, 2017","This is the first time I've ever been compelled to write a movie review. First of all, I want to address the bantha in the room: How the hell did this movie receive a ""Certified Fresh"" rating over 90%?!!! Before I write why I hate this movie with every fibre of my being, I want to Rotten Tomatoes to grow a pair of fresh tomatoes and give this abomination a more accurate assessment and stop misleading people so Disney can set a new record for movie profits. Like many who's imagination was captured and defined as a child by Star Wars I was anxiously awaiting the return of Luke Skywalker in the Force Awakens. When I learned that I would actually have to wait two more years for the character that embodies everything that was awesome about the saga, I sat on my hands and bided my time in the hopes that someone with vision and wisdom would takeover the helm. After all, in our age of social media, it should have been pretty easy to determine what true fans wanted. Instead, we got an incoherent half-comedy unnecessarily teeming with social commentary and ridiculous plot holes. In my opinion, Star Wars is irreparably damaged and no new director will be able to salvage it in Episode IX (which I have no interest in seeing), While the true consensus on this movie is being stifled to make sure it makes enough money in the box office, this movie will go down in history as the movie that retroactively crushed the dreams of millions of children. It is time for Star Wars to end.",1, Ben H

I was much more excited with the series after The Force Awakens. I hope JJ Abrams can redeem the story in IX.",2.5, Steven S

Nonsensical, jumpy plot, painfully awkward attempts at humor, a random, tacked-on love story, and, worst of all, the utter desecration of beloved characters.

"December 24, 2017","SPOILERS --- I can see how people would be disappointed by their fan theories not panning out, or the reveals maybe ""too dull"" in consideration of what could have been done; but personally, I enjoy the idea of someone from a family line of no importance becoming an epic hero. I think it to be actually quite poetic. The Last Jedi tastefully puts the past legacy behind while allowing the possibilities of the future to be hinted at throughout the film. Also, I have seen people complain about the seemingly pointless casino plot, but I think the importance of that plot line is two-fold: it allowed more exposure into the Star Wars universe, and we saw our heroes utterly fail. Their heroism is something we admire and value, but realizing that heroism does not mean victory is a lesson of value in itself. I think this lesson is true throughout the entirety of The Star Wars saga -- heroes may fail, but the good is ultimately victorious. No, I don't think this film was a sellout, rather a successful transition to Episode IX.",4.5, Sue H
"December 24, 2017","They have destroyed in resemblence of a good childhood memory of the Star Wars francised. This move was pure trash. When they killed Luke, they killed this franchise. Disney you fucked up!",0.5, 
"December 24, 2017","The good: For the most part, the visuals are very good. Outstanding, even. I wouldn't be surprised if it won awards for that sort of stuff.

The bad: Everything else. The Last Jedi continues breaking the movies that came before it, and trampling all over the lore. 

Rey is even more powerful with the Force and more skillful with a lightsaber this time around, even though it starts right when the last movie ends, and she received virtually no training from Luke. It's absurd.

If it's one thing that 40 years of lore has taught, it's that it takes years of training, practice and dedication to become proficient with Force use, and to become skillful with a lightsaber. If the aptitude is even there. The Force does not give one the knowledge or skill to do anything, it can only greatly enhance and augment the ability that one already has. 

Abrams and Johnson believe that the Force works like the Matrix. That if you can feel the Force, it simply downloads the required knowledge and skill into you, eliminating any need to learn or train. That isn't how the Force works. It's unconscionable that the writers were handed the reigns to this franchise when they have such little fundamental understanding of Star Wars.

So what about all of those unanswered questions and needed exposition that The Mystery Box Awakens left? Most are still a mystery and unanswered. Let's be honest, they never will be.

Simply because Disney Wars has shifted genres from space opera, science fiction / fantasy.... to fantasy action, because that's where the money is. The genre's primary focus is to entertain. It has common elements: Crazy CGI action scenes, constant forced humor, nothing making any sense, the ""story"" being an afterthought. Flash over substance. See: Transformers.",0.5, Dave H

No villains or true heros. Just soft, spineless millenials who shoot laser guns. Don't even say Rey... apparently 10 min of Jedi Training makes her more powerful than any other Jedi? Here's what really happened, Mickey Mouse found a new series to make money from. Fans. Do not watch. Also, George Lucas... I'd like to take this time to apologize for complaining about episode 1.

Some parts do not make sense: after return of Jedi, as the only Jedi, Luke together with Leia led the whole resistance army to the ground. Were they so bad at leadership?

The new Hollywood trend of stepping all over the past to make room for younger actors and SJW causes does not serve the franchise well. The film was filled with predictably cliche liberal progressive issues and also went out of it's way to portray all the male characters as weak and hot-tempered compared vs cool, collected, wise female characters. In fact, I would say all the villians were male and all protaganists were female. And so many plot holes and needless sub-plots. This was disappointing. [SPOILER ALERT] And the way they treat Luke Skywalker is also sad. And how is Rei able to take on a legion of elite Sith fighters with no training whatsoever?

Snoke's final scene was great and unexpected. Do I need to know his background? Nope not important. So go check out Wookiepedia for some worthless facts. You're mad at Ren?

"December 24, 2017","Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the biggest disappointment of the year and a complete waste of potential; I guess that's what happens when you switch directors half-way through a trilogy. The newest episode of the Star Wars saga is unfortunately met with more criticism than praise from me, so I'll start with what I liked. 

While extremely dissatisfied with what I have recently seen, even I must admit that Star Wars 8 has some things going for it. Like any Star Wars movie, good or bad, the costume design is always top-notch. The Last Jedi keeps the streak alive with more interesting robes and armors for the characters to wear throughout the film; the Imperial Royal Guard-esque uniforms for Snoke's elite guards were slick. Another must for Star Wars movies is high-end visuals. Once again, The Last Jedi does just that, delivering high-quality Star Destroyers, a wide variety of alien races, and the lightsaber blades are still badass. The score composed by the iconic John Williams is an exceptional collection of Star Wars nostalgia, although not as present as it is in other films; the sound design ain't too shabby either. While more than likely just a marketing scheme, the porgs are cute like the Ewoks and might've been the best comic relief in the entire film. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are both really talented up and coming actors and I assume they both have bright futures ahead of them, and while not their best work, the performances they're putting into the Star Wars films are solid. Ridley believably shows Rey's inner-confliction and craving to learn more about her gifts while Driver effectively displays the anger and frustration that has built up in Kylo Ren; I assume they both only get better in the final chapter. Carrie Fisher provides an emotional performance in what may be one of the last times we see Leia on the big screen (I can't imagine she'll have much of a role if any in episode 9). These are the things I liked...I guess. 

If you haven't heard, Star Wars: The Last Jedi has been very divisive among audiences; some people really enjoyed the film, while others have a burning animosity towards the movie. I find myself leaning towards the latter for these reasons: almost all the humor feels forced and does not land, the three storylines that go on throughout the whole film feel very jumbled and poorly paced, the new side characters are annoying, the villains are weak and/or disposed of in an orderly fashion, Rey barely develops as a character if at all, the movie is longer than it needed to be, and the writing is lazy; it felt as if director Rian Johnson wanted to remove almost all of J.J. Abrams' influence from episode 7 and start off fresh. It doesn't work. I found myself dozing in the first half of the film and cringing in the second, it was that bad. To begin the film there is some banter between two characters (I'm going to be very careful about not spoiling anything). I did not find it amusing and it went against the seriousness of one of the antagonists. Since the movie just began I pushed my worries aside thinking there is still a lot of time left for things to get better; I might as well have left that very moment. From there, there are even more silly moments that are neither humorous or Star Wars-like; a solid half hour if not a full one could've been shaved from the film's runtime. As much as I would like to elaborate on my other criticisms, out of not wanting to spoil the film at all (because I know people hate that), I'll just give you a quick word of advice: You may go into Star Wars: The Last Jedi and come out not understanding why all the hate, believing that episode 8 is one of the best Star Wars films to date. That's fine, I wish I could see it that way. Or you may come out feeling neutral. Or you may come out feeling betrayed and extremely underwhelmed wondering where $200 million went. If you liked The Force Awakens and/or Rogue One, you won't necessarily like this one. 

In conclusion, I guess you should go see Star Wars: The Last Jedi and develop your own opinion, just try to temper expectations.",2.5, Teddy F

"December 24, 2017","Well, Star Wars was doomed to be next. Star Trek went down first. Taken down by the real dark side of the force, progressivism. All the poor reviews are essentially correct. This movie is the product of liberal thinking and liberal fantasy. Think about it. Anti-capitalism --- it's there. Feminism --- there. Animal rights --- there. Disregard for anything holy or canon --- there. Nihilism (meaninglessness) --- there. Progressive liberal moviemakers are more interested in changing your thinking then entertaining you. If you complain about a lack of heroism, too bad. Heroes can only exist where there is a common acceptance of right and wrong, and where the first is celebrated. Liberalism can't stand male heroes. That's why they want to take down the NFL eventually.

"December 24, 2017","Disney has ruined the Star Wars franchise in an effort to cut ties with George Lucas and the former Star Wars characters. This is a politically correct corporate designed please everyone film with a feminist slant that seems to negatively portray all male characters, and suffers from a complete misunderstanding of the moral compass and character of Luke Skywalker and the force. The moral authority that drove the philosophy of the force that so many fans identified with is completely gone. Oh, and let us not forget the Mary Poppins portrayal of Princess Leia. This film evoked no emotion in me as I watched, other than knowing the themes and hope I grew up on were over in this franchise.

"December 24, 2017","A single opinion filled with spoiler. The treatment of Luke's character left me flat and quite frankly pretty miserable. Narrative of the movie is spent building up the return of Luke after his failure with his Nephew. To a degree he does return, to the point it even looks like the character will perform powerful feats show in books and comics, in particular Dark Empire. The nerdgasm as you could call it was about to be off the charts. Instead of an awesome display of what Luke's often thought of capabilities, he is written delivering a hoodwink. Not only on the villain but the audience also. This is made even more unsatisfying by the fact he just dies because he's tired afterwards.

A huge disappointment after building up so much good will.",2, Paul J
"December 24, 2017","Spoilers ahead, be forewarned: I enjoyed this movie greatly, and strangely for a reason some many of the negative reviews highlight--the treatment of Luke. Luke has always been a conflicted character walking the path between light and dark. To me it makes complete sense that he would tire of this battle, and being the last Jedi, simply turn his back on the Jedi (and Force) in frustration. To see him wrestle with this decision and then ultimately be redeemed, to me, makes this one of the better movies. I really get a sense of who Luke, as a real person, actually is, and what he struggles with. As for the rest of the movie, I like Rey as a Jedi, and it's a relief to find a character who is aggressively committed to the light side. She is not conflicted, which is refreshing in a series filled with flawed heroes. Similarly, though she's a side character, I also like Rose as well. The only draw backs for me are that the movie tries to do a lot in a short time (Ren's move toward being a Jedi; the rescue of the rebel fleet; the redemption of Luke); and the obvious lack of resolution as we lead to a third movie in the series.",4.5, Dan L

"December 24, 2017","THE DEATH OF EVERYTHING WE LOVED ABOUT STAR WARS

I feel so bad for today's kids. I grew up on the original Star Wars trilogy, which clearly laid out how love, calm, and self sacrifice = the light side of the Force. Hatred, anger, selfishness = the Dark Side. It was pretty clear cut, and helped guide my morale compass growing up almost as much as anything. Luke embodied these ideals and struggled with the darkness and the light through his 3 story arc, before solidifying himself as the greatest hero in the history of movie-dom by saving his father and the galaxy. And now we have TLJ, where Disney threw everything we hold dear out the window. Luke is destroyed and is treated lower than dirt. The Force is destroyed. The main character Rey is essentially a Sith in the employ of the Resistance with her rampant use of the dark side. The rebellion is destroyed. Everything the rebellion worked for in the original trilogy is destroyed. Don't worry though, the Porgs and horse-dogs are saved! yay! Because that seems to be an actual priority for some characters in this movie (over, say, saving the lives of their friends.)

A tremendous disservice has been done to older, and newer characters. This movie ignores or completely reversed things set up in the previous film; as well as ignoring some established mechanics of the Star Wars Universe. A main theme of the movie, which an entire plot line had been devoted to, seems to be to deliver the political message that slavery is bad, and people get rich off of war, and is being hailed as the most intellectual Star Wars movie because of it? It feels anything but; a disjointed and un-cohesive mess. The over 90% critic rating is insane, and goes to show you how much people are afraid to get blacklisted by Disney.

"December 24, 2017","not as good as the critics say but not as bad the audience would lead you to believe. After that decent but unoriginal force awakens this film is a big let down. Instead of building on what JJ started and doing something original Rian chose to barely move the plot forward and have a bunch of NOTHING happen. Leia flying in space tops Jar Jar as the worst thing ever in a star wars film

Setting the entire movie on a space ship slowly flying away from another space ship is an odd choice. Doesnt seem like much of a war. Very little explanation how the empire took over the galaxy in a few days even after its NOT the death star blew up. Scenes with Luke and Rey and the Rey/Kylo relationship were handled well

everything on the rebel ship and space vegas were pointless and bad. Fans of Finn will be disappointed. Why these movies refuse to give us a buddy cop style team up with Crazy Poe and Finn the janitor is beyond me. They are two most likable characters.

"December 24, 2017","MILD SPOILERS!!! As a HUGE fan of the Star Wars saga for entire life (and I've been around for every installment) I thought The Last Jedi, as a film, was one of the best ever made. There were some genuine surprises (which is hard to do these days) and great performances (particularly from Mark Hammil and Adam Driver). As a child, Luke Skywalker was MY GUY. I read an article about the movie which said he ""wasn't just my hero, he was THE hero of my generation"" and I could not agree more. If you fall in this category like me, I can understand why you left this film a little conflicted, I certainly did. I was also disappointed with how severely they under utilized Finn, one of my favorite new characters as well as the Rose character, who I felt was poorly acted/written and out of place. She was a central character who was difficult to care about. Overall, with time to reflect, the movie itself was great and moves the franchise forward, making Rey and Kylo Ren even more the focal point, as they should be now. I don't understand the backlash, great movie overall!",4, Paul A
"December 24, 2017","This movie is so incredibly disappointing that I signed up here to simply release some frustration. I do not post or opine anywhere else on the internet. Politically, I would consider myself a progressive. It doesn't bother me that we have a woman as the protagonist in this trilogy. it doesn't bother me that Black, Hispanic, and Asian actors have prominent leading roles either. The world needs to see and be inspired by this diverse cast. The diverse cast was wasted and rendered useless by an incredibly terrible movie. The rest of the forced social narratives in this movie were egotistical and downright insulting to intelligent people everywhere. The director basically destroyed the other other 7 movies in the saga just to make his points. Star Wars has always been about EPIC political, spiritual, and historical themes. You used to have to look a lot deeper to gain that understanding of those movies. This movie feels like a Social Justice infomercial and destroys plenty of Star Wars lore, mythology, and characters just to make those points.",0.5, Chris C
"December 24, 2017","This is the most divisive star wars movie. Star Wars fans are writing on twitter and many blogs and are hating it. Casual fans are liking it. The truth stands somewhere in the middle. I give writer director Rian Johansson credit as he took a lot of serious risks in this movie and some of it does work. There are some major problems in the movie that cannot be ignored however. It is completely discontinued from the Force Awakens. The last scene from the Force Awakens is a powerful scene between Rey and Luke as she is handing him his lightsaber. Remember this is the lightsaber from Empire Strikes Back that was lost in his fight against Vader. This was captured perfectly by JJ Abrams as the facial expression from Luke is surprised, happy angry .... You can feel all these emotions. Well to turn this intense moment into a joke in The Last Jedi, just did not work for me. What we always found in Star Wars is light humour but also sentimental caring for the characters. Every moment were we get to a caring moment was quickly replaced with an impromptu joke. This did not work for me. Back to the discontinued portion. You cannot do character placement and development in Force Awaken with Snoke and have him become so irrelevant to the story in The Last Jedi. So many questions will go unexplained. Where did he come from? How did he go about contacting and turning Kylo to the dark side? It doesn't really matter according to Rian Johansson because that is not where he is taking this story. Luke is one of the most beloved Star Wars character. Mark Hamill is great btw in this movie. He really nailed the role as an older Luke. However you have to give him more to do in the movie. Yes in the final installment he plays an important role. And the scene with the two suns is beautiful and moving and a great flashback to New Hope. However this is Luke Skywalker. I think it could have been written better. Also the whole Lea flying scene .... Seriously!!!. Finally in the things that did not work. The whole 30 minutes trip to the casino was a complete waste of time. It didn't even feel that it was part of the same movie.

There are things however that are extremely well done in this movie and they should be noted. The cinematography is the best I have seen in any star wars movie. As the trailer said ""this will not go the way you expect"". That is absolutely true (I think btw this was overdone). Clearly the feedback from Force Awakens is that it was too much like New Hope. Here the director decides he will completely surprise the audience at every turn. I liked the fact that I could not tell what was going to happen next (however you cannot completely forget what Force Awakens had setup). The actors were really well directed in this movie. Adam driver, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher etc ... You never felt that a certain scene could have been played better by the actor. I give kudos to the director as he really did a nice job with this. The fight scene in the Supreme Leader Chamber is one of the best I have ever seen in a star wars movie. The final battle scene on the red salt planet is just magnificent. 

I think Disney has got to find a middle ground in this trilogy. Find ways to surprise the audience but still cater to the Star Wars fans that require certain things from these movies.",2.5, Christian M

The script focuses entirely too much on what were as I can only imagine supposed to be funny quips, that were recieved as out of place and wasted diologue. The amount of cutesie lines and fauna come across as Disney being an over bearing try-hard. This does not feel like Star Wars at all. At times - think the entirety of the Casino sequences - it felt like a spinoff of The Hunger Games. Most other places it reminded me that if Disney ever wrote a drama series, that I would steer clear of that disaster.

"December 24, 2017","From the perspective of someone who was in the audience (at age 5) for the first movie, and grew up with the ideas and myths of star wars very much as a core part of my world view, this movie hurt, and this movie was beautiful, and pretty much perfect as a continuation of the series.

Were some of the plot developments hard to take? Absolutely yes. And if I had grown up following the stories of young Ben Kenobi, only to find out he'd become an eccentric desert hermit content to keep his head down while his enemies brutalized the entire galaxy, it would have been uncomfortable. And had he then almost immediately sacrificed himself so that others could carry the story forward - well yes. I'd have been outraged.

Were there goofy antics and strange choices made throughout the film? Absolutely yes. And when I was a kid, the Jawas were pure delight, the Ugnaughts playing keep-away with Threepio's head totally worked, and nobody batted an eye at a gargantuan snorting pig men or cackling rat monkeys. Even more importantly - every cornball joke in the Last Jedi brought gales of laughter from the children in the audience.

Was this the star wars episode 8 I expected? No. And thank the maker. Because how boring would that get?

I am just as surprised, and shaken, and excited to find out what comes next as I was after Empire, when my hero got ambushed by a yeti, floated around in a space diaper, seemingly won and then LOST the girl we all loved to a scoundrel, got endlessly trolled by a wacky elf puppet, flaked out on his jedi training to fall into a blatant trap, saved literally nobody, got his hand cut off, found out he was the son of seemingly the worst person in the universe, and then needed to be rescued. Brilliant. 

As a side note - I want Mark Hamill to crowd fund an independent film project to show us the old man adventures of an unnamed mystic space adventurer with a laser sword. As a fan - holy heck Mark - please do it. I am sure we would pay for it. If you did it using the film magic techniques we saw back in 1977, you could do it without costing billions to produce.

A last note: we've been watching these people drink blue milk products for 40 years now. And yes - this time I was aghast. And the 8 year olds in the row ahead of me were delighted. And I could feel the force ghost of my father sitting next to me rolling his eyes, and pointing out how silly parts of star wars were for the grown-ups in the audience back in 1977 too. Perfection.

Thank you Mark Hamill, for inspiring so many of us for all these years, and for having the grace and humor to do everything you've done.

Thank you Rian Johnson, for not playing it safe, and for looking forward instead of back.

And thank you George Lucas, for setting this all in motion, and for building something that has become such a point of importance and passion to so many of us.",5, Noel H

"December 24, 2017","I'm not huge on reviews for movies as everyone has different taste in entertainment. Being a Star Wars fan, I was let down by a number of items. **Spoilers ahead** The ""Flight of Leia"" was a joke and the killing of two could be major characters without explanation was a completer letdown from the director/writer. There was little to no character development in this film except that of Luke and his character didn't so much develope but regressed. Only redeeming quality for this particular flashback scene was that it played well into ""fear leads to the dark side of the force.""

THE GOOD:

-Kylo and Rey's force connection and discussions; interesting, although they kept interrupting them with humor that seemed out of place.

-The action; pretty cool action scenes

-Popcorn movie feel; I'm not terribly annoyed I saw this in a theater

-the hacker; Benecio del Toro's characters' brief musings on war and profiteering were interesting.

-Some of the humor; they used too many gags, but some were quite funny

-The acting, in general, is pretty good. Daisey Ridley, and, especially, Adam Driver, are fantastic.

THE BAD:

-The Kylo/Rey payoff; it felt lazy. The whole movie builds towards letting go of the past, and almost hints at a point where the jedi, sith, rebels, and empire are forgotten, and something new, that comes in the grey area, arises. But nope. Wasted opportunity

-Idiocy; The leaders of both sides, and Poe and Amdiral Holdo are particularly idiotic, to the point of breaking suspension of disbelief.

-Rey and BB-8 are still far too Mary Sue like, particularly BB-8 in this one.

-New characters we don't get invested in; Rose and Admiral Holdo felt forced, introduced too fast to develop character attachments.

-The timeline; it makes no goddamn sense; and who the fuck is funding the first order. The empire, I get it, they usurped the galactic republic, with its massive population and giant economy. But the republic was back, so who the hell is giving this imperial offshoot the money to build supermassive capital ships and star system killing death star bases the size of planets?

-Disjointed; no real payoff, feels like one long chase seen

-Good thing Rose, a random republic mechanic, could deduce the method and countermeasure to a never before seen imperial system of hyperspace tracking

-Plot holes: big enough to drive a super star destroyer through.

-Wasting characters like captain Phasma...again.

THE UGLY:

-Luke; as Mark Hamill himself has stated, this character got a terrible treatment in this movie, and that breaks from everything Luke had been built up to be.

-Incongruity; While The Force Awakens was clearly designed to let anyone continue the Star Wars story afterwards, one would think at least a FEW of the important questions would be answered, other than potentially who Rey's parents were. Its very, very obvious that the same person who made TLJ did not make TFA

-The entire Finn/Rose subplot and Casino world seen could be cut with no drop off in quality of the film. It was simply a place to try and make a clumsy (and alltogether nonsensical) political statement.

-Misleading; The exploration of Jedi mythos and morality was just about absent, reduced to two scenes. Given the trailers, this feels like a massive deception

-leias Mary Poppins moment

OVERALL:

-It wasn't terrible, but it was also far from good. Easily the weakest of any Star Wars flick not containing Jar Jar Binks or Hayden Chistensen. Over-complicated, it loses its way, and pays off little to none of the series new topics and questions raised by TFA.

I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad Michael Bay is back to direct Episode 9.",2.5, James R
"December 24, 2017",rian Johnson is an utter disgrace and has done something I thought unthinkable make the worst star wars movie in the entire franchise. Whats worse is that not only did he make a horrible movie he actually destroyed every single movie and show in all of star wars. (spoilers) by 1 opening scene horrible physics where apparently space battles are fought like in ww2 and shps being able to ram in light speed. literally makes every even in every movie broken. Not to mention how he shit on everything foreshadowed in awakens and essentially made them two non coherent films ... the fact critics are over 90 on this shows how bought and paid for these morons are. This is a disgusting disappointment. the entire film needs to be re edited by jj abrams and any re shoots should be paid for by rian johnson.... who created lazy horrible plot points and characters.. . ],0.5, Jason J
"December 24, 2017","Star wars and myself have had a troubled relationship, with ups and downs, times filled with hope, and also by despair. I fear this may be the last time i drag myself to a Star wars movie in hope.

 People have commented that fan boys such as myself hate the movie because of strong female characters, but the reality is, that it doesnt matter whether the lead is female or not. Sigourney Weaver in Alien, Linda Hamilton in Terminator, Charlize Theron in Mad Max Fury Road, all great actors, all great characters, and all great movies that i go back to time and time again. I wont lie, and say i wasn't dissapointed in not seeing some of my favourite characters kick some ass and make a difference. Namely that some random chick with purple hair, an unknown that has no connection to the audience, saves the rebellion by kamikaze into the enemy fleet. Why her, when Ackbar, one of the most iconic characters of the entire franchise, dies in the scene before, and only warrents a fleeting reference about his death. Surely his death in that instance would have been so much more dramatic and memorable. 

Also, surely in this day and age, it is recognized that the villans are just as important, if not more so, than the protaginists? Think Heath Ledger in Batman. This movie falls far short in this department, with all of the First Order officers weak, ineffectual, and incompetant, its actually cringe worthy. Snokes death is meaningless, and disappointing as, it turns out he is not really very powerful at all, or very intelligent for that matter when it comes to the means of his death. And Kylo Ren is scared of his own shadow, and hides more often than not. Its hard to be satified when an enemy like this is defeated.

In the original trilogy, lucas tried to bring some realism to the star wars universe, it was gritty, used...... dirty, and you could believe it was real. The charcters acted in a way that was believable. And yes, Luke was a whiney little brat, but he was treated with a certain contempt from the other characters because of it. Han Solo was a cold blooded killer with no fear, and no speaches on morality, he just got on with what he had to do, like most people do, instead of standing on their moral soap box every 5 minutes.

I wish the people who enjoyed this movie the best of luck in their continuing journey forward with the Star wars franchise, unfortunately, after 30 years, this is where i get off.",1, Samuel P

"December 24, 2017",TLJ as an individual entity is a fine movie but as a part of bigger franchise that this movie failed to deliver the purpose of connect with past and setup for the future.

"December 24, 2017","Truly shocked at the lacklustre writing and poor character development. As a long time Star Wars fan, this was a huge disappointment, to have taken one of the most beloved Star Wars characters and turn't him into a joke is mind boggling. The biggest disgrace of it all has to be the out of placed and forced 'Disney' humour, apparently it isn't enough to add in cheap gimmicky characters for the sake of selling merchandise..they also need to constantly whip out a cheap joke to completely ruin any form of tension and suspense. Worst of the entire saga by far.",1.5, Fahran Y
"December 24, 2017","Disney has made it clear that their new movies are made for everyone EXCEPT me and everyone like me. (A white male who loved the original movies). It is a disgrace that the saga of Luke has been destroyed by the liberal media's push for what they call diversity. With that aside, the last 2 movies have SUCKED! They have created a ridicules story line full of ridicules excuses of why they made the decisions they made. It has been admitted in interviews that they couldn't have Luke predominately featured in the new movies because he would steal the movie from the newcomers that they were so eager to force on us. Well, that's what happened! The best parts of the movie were the Luke scenes. You know why? Because the movie was promoted with the original cast in order to get the original fans excited for something we have waited many years for, a conclusion. They have given us no conclusion to the 9 movie saga that was first envisioned by Lucas. They gave us a mirage! Why? Because they wanted our money! They don't want to represent ""my kind"" other than Nazi type roles by British actors but they sure want my money. They sacrificed a good story in order to fill political and social diversity needs of their own. I am all for having any color or race of actor in a movie but you can't just change what something has been for over 30 years. They should have finished the story and then introduced their own vision going forward. Anyone that would ague that these movies are finishing the story are delusional and not true Star Wars fans! These characters could have been part of the spin-offs but that would not have brought in as much money. The comic relief they attempted in this movie is too forced. The original movies would not have killed thousands then 2 minutes later have the lead characters joking and being ecstatic. If you are an original fan, Save your money! This is not for us!",0.5, Robert D
"December 24, 2017","I'll start by saying I loved The Force Awakens and thought Rouge One was ever better. I couldn't wait to see those moves a second time. The Last Jedi disappoints on so many levels that I don't feel any need to see it again. There are some very cool special effects for sure, but that's pretty much it. The story is...boring. It just is. The character interaction is just strange. Outside of Kylo Ren and Ray, the characters don't seem to have a lot of chemistry or memorable scenes. 

Also....I can normally or give some latitude to scene when the force is involved, because after all it is The Force. However, Leia flying through space and Yoda creating lighting are in my opinion bizarre and not in the spirt of the force, I'm not sure I can forgivable those scenes. 

Sadly...I will not be seeing this one again.",1.5, Timothy R

"December 24, 2017",Disappointing. Many fans have waited decades to see their childhood hero Luke Skywalker as a powerful Jedi Master and we were given a cry baby whiner who lost the will to live. So many plot holes and wasted sub plot.,0.5, 
"December 24, 2017",wow. I want my money back. no story kills anything good about luke. rian johnson must hate luke,1, 
"December 24, 2017","As a stand alone move, or as a continuation of The Force Awakens, this is a fine movie, though with some plot holes. For example, if Luke doesn't want to be found, why does he leave a map to his whereabouts?

Visually, the movie is really good, the humour is in sync with recent fantasy, and some of the character arcs will interest some people, especially young people. 

On the other hand, if you're already a fan of Star Wars, this movie will likely hurt you. A young fan might not notice, but people with a few years under their belt will find Luke, especially, seriously out of character. In the past, his flaws were such things the naivety of hope, faith in his friends, trust that good will win. He had no tendencies to give up or a wish death to family members whose choices he disagrees with. 

Further, according to this movie, nothing that happened in the original trilogy had any impact. Everything is the same, even though in the original series they defeated the empire (and presumably dismantled it) while revealing the hidden evil in their society. They even had Darth Vader's force ghost to tell them where are the Sith were hiding. Nothing changing is a highly unlikely outcome. 

In a nutshell, this movie has detached itself from the originals, in tone and character, and is going its own way. If you don't care, then you will likely enjoy this movie. If you do care, and especially if you're old enough to know how things really work -- how people change and evolve in reality for example -- you will likely hate this movie.",2.5, Tim G
"December 24, 2017",Espetacular! Ponto final!!!,5, 
"December 24, 2017",SJW Trash. And a total slap in the face to those of us that grew up as fans.,1.5, 
"December 24, 2017","Never before had I such an urge to register and write a review about a movie. Why care? Really. But after seeing TLJ I couldn't resist. 

This movie sucks major balls. I am neither a Trump supporter, nor a racist, nor asexist. Yet i feel annoyed about the political lectures this movie tries to enforce upon me. Even while writing this review about a movie that in my honest opinion was the worst Star Wars Movie ever, I feel the pressure to defend myself. So here, I am a Bernie supporter and live as a foreigner in a different country. 

So what is so bad about this movie? 

Well, SPOILERS incoming! You have been warned. 

You take the heroes of the past and sh1t all over them in the most dis-respectable way possible. Grumpy old man Luke, who believed and succeeded as a young man to turn the most evil guy in the Galaxy towards the light side, is now ready to kill a kid who has a tendency towards the dark side, a tendency not strong enough to kill his mother btw... This broken Hero and potential child killer milks a disgusting looking alien, which seemingly enjoys it, and goes on fishing with the most dramatic music ever. He tells the new hero, Rey, phuck the Galaxy, phuck yourself and leave me alone. Yeah, great portrayal there. I wonder who brainwashed the Luke from the original trilogy and made him such a huge arse. 

Bombs that fall on the biggest Ship you have seen in a most natural way, through an open door where a girl is just breathing in the vacuum of space. 

Laia Merry Poppins reanimating her frozen and dead body in space and showing Superman how it is done, the flying I mean.

A love story hinted on Rey and Kylo that feels as forced as the retarded jokes, which come BTW in the most unfitting moments. 

Plot holes and coincidences along a race through space at speeds you can only describe as suspend animation. Characters no one can really cares about, Rey was likable in TFA (which I would give a rating of 85% BTW) even though she was a Mary Sue character. She still had this mystery, you know what this mystery is all about? Nothing, she is a nobody, that nobody loved or cared about. That's all we learn... This was the char I had the greatest hopes for, from all the new chars. 

Poe is an idiot, we get it, he needs the guidance of strong woman, we get it. Don't care about him. But why not tell him about this plan of Holdo, I mean this is all the resistance has left anyway, there is no room for treason anyway. 

Rose and Finns journey to the place where all the evil weapon sellers and real life caricatures of real life billionaires enjoy their lives by enslaving animals and children. Yeah Disney, we got this hint, it's no rocket science to force-feed us this great revelation with a 50 minutes spoon of wasted lifetime. 

Actually, this movie was meaningless. The plot was stupid and could be done within 30 minutes. Old characters are only there to be shit on, new chars are boring emos who have no reason to exist except to explain us why the political view of Disney is the right one and everything else is just there to sell merchandising products (like those ultra creepy porgs) after you watched this 2 hours and 50 minutes sh1tfest.Thanks for nothing Disney, except for ruining another franchise and phuck you. Leave our real life politics out of the Galaxy far far away and try to tell a story next time.

Star Wars is dead, long live the Social Justice Wars or whatever this was supposed to be. And yeah, Disney can buy the critics before it hits the theaters to lure us into this sh1t but it's not bots, nor right wing people, nor man, who tend to disagree with you. Try to exucse this pure rating as much as you want, truth is, you are just a bunch of manipulative, greedy basterds who don't give a sh1t about the chars from SW or the franchise itself.",0.5, Mind C
"December 24, 2017","Special affects were good as expected. Scenes with Rey were good. everything involving the rebels was poor. Poorly written, lowbrow at times, and the plot was so foolishly structured that my initial theory was that they cut out half the movie and this is all they could cobble together. Two themes seem to have driven this failure. Feminism- why did the movie have to be so obstuse? we already have Rey the strongest action figure in cinema today as the center of the movie, and lea as the experienced leader. The pointless continual belittling of all male characters had more to do with todays polical climate than any sort of logical or entertaining story telling. Second and this is huge, but subtle. There are certain unwritten rules in star wars, droids dont kill, and we had a vague but understood set of rules governing spaceflight. If we accept what we learned in this, then all any one should do in any space flight is to put a droid on a lightspeed capable craft and launch it at anything you want to destroy. Why on earth was there ever a raid on the death star, all we had to do was send one ship at light speed right through it. 

 Im not a giant star wars fan, but the movies (the first 3 and the two before this) have been great fun. I really enjoyed them and looked forward to seeing them in the theater. This kinda sucked, and its sad because with an even passable story line, minus the obtuse feminism this would have been great.",0, matt m
"December 24, 2017","The film was well acted and directet, unfortunately it was not well written. It ignores the prestablished rules of the Star Wars universe, has idiot plots, and betrays the core personality of key characters. It is a sad waste of talent and potential.",0.5, Nathan L
"December 24, 2017","Huge disappointment. So much wrong with it, can't be bothered to explain every single problem. 

Basically it's just 10 minutes of actual plot spread across two and a half hours of film. Nothing much story-wise actually happens. I could've left the cinema for an hour in the middle and not missed anything. 

Any interesting ideas left from The Force Awakens are either disposed of, or mocked. The entire Force Awakens buildup of searching for Luke across the galaxy is just pissed in the wind. Talk about an anticlimax! And it basically just lifts its ideas from Empire and ROTJ.

Phasma is pointless, Finn does nothing, Chewie does nothing. Poe is just meh. Laura Dern, why?! 'Fish nun' creatures? 

Completely misses the mark for me. I love Rian Johnson's previous work, don't think he was right for this at all.

"December 24, 2017",Worst Star Wars ever. Nihilism and pure disrespect.,2.5, 
"December 24, 2017","One of the main premises in the Last Jedi is that death must occur in order for life to spring from the ashes. Consequently the director feels justified in trashing the legacy of the beloved characters that originally brought this universe to life. The new characters are particularly stunted by poor writing that never allows them to grow through adversity or become compelling heroes apart from the shoulders they stand on. Even stranger is how the film makers build upon and yet subsequently trample feelings of nostalgia with their use of cinematic elements and script. In the end, the audience is left with no consolation for the two and half hours they wasted watching everything they loved about Star Wars slowly and systematically decomposing.",0.5, Lydia H

I felt disappointed that it felt like 2 separate stories. it was a long movie with a lot of complex situations occurring. So, that made it difficult to process the first go around. However, the 2nd time, I saw it and enjoyed it much more. Scenes and storyline made sense. I was in as much shock of Luke's character. But, at the end, he was sure powerful doing what no Jedi has ever done - force projecting himself to defeat an enemy! I ound the movie to be well made. It was a powerful ending of one chapter and start of the next! I look forward to the next episode!",4, Ray L
"December 24, 2017","Great performances from Mark Hamill, Adam Driver & Daisy Ridley highlight this film for me together with the unique take of Rian Johnson's storytelling. His visual style is pretty amazing too.

Okay, maybe I didn't love everything about it... the humor was slightly overdone in places for my tastes, and there was probably more plot events than this movie really needed. The casino planet stuff didn't totally land for me for one, for one.

But I also really enjoyed that it felt like a new story that didn't depend only nostalgia for most of its key plot points. *And* there are four or five scenes in this movie that are so jaw-droppingly assured, surprising and original that I couldn't quite believe they were in a Star Wars film.

In comparison, this was probably somewhat better than Force Awakens for me, but not as quite good as Rogue One.",4, Eric G

I am trying to not get swallowed up with nostalgia but there is just no denying the original trilogy is simply much better than the sequel trilogy films. Main reason. A sense of threat. There is none inthe new films. It's like Disney are terrified to make them too dramatic in case the six year olds get too scared. I notice that with rogue one they were not concerned about this. Perhaps that is because they are not as concerned about revenue with the stand alones than they are with the main trilogy now. A real shame. Wayyy to much weird humour in the new film which made the pacing of the movies very strange and unusual. Hundreds of people are dying. Let's crack a joke. Force awakens was the same.

"December 24, 2017","The 1st time I saw it, I was kind of taken back. I was looking for answers as a continuation of Force Awakens. I felt disappointed that it felt like 2 separate stories. it was a long movie with a lot of complex situations occurring. So, that made it difficult to process the first go around. However, the 2nd time, I saw it and enjoyed it much more. Scenes and storyline made sense. I was in as much shock of Luke's character. But, at the end, he was sure powerful doing what no Jedi has ever done - force projecting himself to defeat an enemy! I ound the movie to be well made. It was a powerful ending of one chapter and start of the next! I look forward to the next episode!",4, Ray L
"December 24, 2017","Great performances from Mark Hamill, Adam Driver & Daisy Ridley highlight this film for me together with the unique take of Rian Johnson's storytelling. His visual style is pretty amazing too.

Okay, maybe I didn't love everything about it... the humor was slightly overdone in places for my tastes, and there was probably more plot events than this movie really needed. The casino planet stuff didn't totally land for me for one, for one.

But I also really enjoyed that it felt like a new story that didn't depend only nostalgia for most of its key plot points. *And* there are four or five scenes in this movie that are so jaw-droppingly assured, surprising and original that I couldn't quite believe they were in a Star Wars film.

In comparison, this was probably somewhat better than Force Awakens for me, but not as quite good as Rogue One.",4, Eric G

Perhaps that is because they are not as concerned about revenue with the stand alones than they are with the main trilogy now. A real shame. Wayyy to much weird humour in the new film which made the pacing of the movies very strange and unusual. Hundreds of people are dying. Let's crack a joke. Force awakens was the same.

Chewbacca turns Vegan, the list goes on. Not sure how they're going to rectify any of this in Episode 9. Good luck!",1, 
"December 24, 2017","I have been looking forward to seeing the Last Jedi since the end of the Force Awakens two years ago. Though that movie was OK, I felt it was far too much a copy of a New Hope but it still half worked. It posed interesting questions going forward, and as it was seen mainly from Rey's point of view (an abandoned child on a backwater planet) we still had the mystery of galactic politics and the First Order to be revealed. 

So where the Force Awakens only half worked for me, it was entertaining. Alas, its sequel falls flat in so many areas that when I left the cinema I was genuinely disappointed. 

SPOILERS BELOW: 

It all stems from the writing and the plot. Fans of the Last Jedi and movie critics seem to praise it for something new: but this isn't new. In fact, it is almost a carbon copy of Empire Strikes Back (Rebels on the run after being hounded out of a base, try to get help from a 'charming' character, Jedi apprentice on a location with a Jedi Master). It also steals the throne room scene from Return of the Jedi, giving a slight twist that left me more puzzled than entertained (that Snoke bit!). Finally, it ends up with Luke returning to grant the remains of the rebels time enough to escape a battle which is so like the battle of Hoth that it's just ridiculous. 

So there is actually very little new in this film, and the determination to kill off the older characters leaves what is left on very shaky foundations indeed. I pity the writer who has to put episode 9 together with the leftovers - time will have to be devoted to explaining Princess Leia's absence after Carrie Fisher's death, and the main antagonist now is so weak that I can't imagine the First Order will hold together for duration after suffering 2 catastrophic defeats. 

Onto specifics of why I didn't like this movie then: 

1. Plot holes. In some movies you can let these slide, but not so in this one. The main rebel scene involving a sublight spaceship chase is so contrived it's actually frustrating! Why don't the First Order ships just hyperspace a single ship to cut them off? We know it's possible as it is done later in the movie in reverse. This type of writing makes me think they took the audience for granted and is just unforgivable. 

2. Character motivation only for plot. With the writing being so weak, character's motivations are highly suspect but needed to get them to go from A to B or so something to move the plot forward. The big one here is Rey surrendering to the First Order after being with Luke for about 2 days and not learning anything. Rey has only known about the Force for no more than 3 days or so, as The Force Awakens and the Last Jedi take place back to back and yet she still thinks that she senses good in Kylo Renn and surrenders herself to him and Snoke just to convert him back to the light. This is without any knowledge of Snoke and his abilities, and comes immediately after Star Killer base was used to commit mass genocide in the Force Awakens that killed billions, perhaps trillions of beings. It just doesn't stand up to the simplest scrutiny. Bad motivation also rears its head with other characters in the film and forces them to make stupid and lazy decisions to move the plot along: such as Rose knocking Finn's salt-speeder off course to stop him making the final sacrifice to save the Resistance. It's just lazy and incompetent story telling. 

 

3. HIGHLY derivative new characters; DJ is Lando again without the charm, Max Katana is basically a female gun slinging Yoda whose appearance in the film left me puzzled than entertained. 

4. No thought from a trilogy point of view (no questions answered from Force Awakens). Don't they even have a story arc of where they want the characters to go? It appears not - apparently Rian Johnson was given free rein over this when he pitched his script and didn't cross-check it with the movie that went before. OK, I don't mind having things left unanswered but they have to be done in the right way, not just ignored. 

6. Character failures: Luke's character was dreadful. More so his reasons for becoming what is supposed to be in this movie. He's turned his back on everything and has abandoned all the teachings of the Jedi because ""they were so arrogant they let the dark side rise."" Hang on Luke - the Dark Side is rising again without the Jedi (this might have been better done if we knew more about Snoke!) and Luke's belief that the Jedi should end is basically taking out the only safe guard of Force users in the galaxy. Without any training, do you think more people growing up with these powers will go to the Dark Side? Of course they will! Grrrr. The internal logic of this film is just awful. Luke's solution to a problem basically consists of ""If I just walk way from it it will go away."" Even Mark Hamill said he fundamentally disagreed with this version of Luke - and I think he is 100% right. 

I really don't understand how critics can have ignored all these points. There are good things: the effects and cinematography, but these are just fluff when the story and logic is so poor. 

It's a real, real shame, as this could have been a good movie had the writing been more on the ball (though it is still a clone of Empire and the throne room from Jedi). 

A wasted opportunity that flies wide off the mark and will leave many viewers disappointed.",1, T C

It was Disney turning Star Wars into another crappy Marvel universe that they can do whatever will make them money with, by throwing away established lore, characters and rules. The other reviewers have covered it pretty well. I'll say this though, the biggest, most unforgivable sins were, 1) Luke Skywalker as a character has been ruined. Why would he see the good in Vader, but try to kill Ben in his sleep? Especially when Vader was Space Hiter and Ben was a kid. Give me a beak. 2) Rey is a Mary Sue. There's no denying it now. With no struggling or development whatsoever, in a matter of a couple days, she's as powerful as Kylo, who was trained under both Luke and Snoke. Again, give me a break.

"December 24, 2017","TLJ was rubbish. A disgrace to the Star Wars Saga. Its story was soul-less and shallow. There was scant little onto which an intellectual thread could be latched. What I disliked the most in TFA was the constant regurgitation of old ideas, plots and scenarios, cheap and mass produced attempts to use nostalgia to recreate the magic of the original trilogy. This time around they kept it down to an almost tolerable level but were clumsily mish-mashed in with a cargo freighters' load of plot holes and twists that infested the movie like drifting space junk. Keeping the viewer engaged for two and a half hours does require a pretty great script and this one certainly wasn't. There were moments that felt like the Empire Strikes back but no sooner did you begin to settle into the train of the story (after several failed attempts and more than half way through the movie) than a plot hole, twist or gag jumped out of light speed and crudely slapped you in the face. I left the movie theatre feeling I had just stepped off a cab ride across the city with a lead-for-feet-and-hands pilot at the wheel.

I like to think that Rian Johnson is a fine film writer and director and that in TLJ, he was tied down to a strict contractual brief from Disney to produce a mega-bucks earner for a younger audience that will ensure the financial success of future installments, shoot-offs and merchandise. After all, isn't that why Disney purchased Star Wars in the first place? In this current generation, they don't need to waste time wiriting up even a half-baked story for a new Star Wars movie to sell. Just throw in ample CGI, a few choreographed fight scenes and silly characters clowning around in any random order. The film critics who gave the movie positive reviews : you can tell us - Disney paid you all handsomely didn't they? This leaves the fans of the original trilogy, those old dreamers who can't stop moaning about the good ol' days - they're no longer in the easy-money formula so riddance to them - and easily done for our galaxy contains something far more powerful than the force : it's called the dollar.",1.5, andy l

"December 24, 2017","I personally have always enjoyed the ideas in Rian Johnson's Films when it comes to Looper, Brick, and The Brothers Bloom. But this is one where I can't get behind everything.

I felt that this film was too long and it was stretched too thin. On one hand, you have the Resistance trying to escape the First Order, but seemingly can't escape the tracking. And on the other hand, you have Rey being trained by Luke Skywalker. Let's talk about the first plot: Resistance escaping. This moment would be fine if it had been more tense and more focused than what it was. Instead, we get a useless Casino Planet Plot Line that eventually leads to nowhere causing the film's pacing to be slowed down. The Rose Character just doesn't work for this film either. She just gets in the way most of the time of completing any sort of goals.

Now, with Rey and Luke Skywalker, it was underwhelming as well. Luke hardly trains her and yet when she leaves, she can still hold her own against people with more training. She only has one force lesson and apparently, that's enough to also learn how to handle a lightsaber.

The characters never really progressed in this movie. In fact, the characters are the same at the end as they were in the beginning. There's no reason left for Kylo Ren to be evil other than for the sake of being evil (that's a weak motivation). There are also specific moments in this film that were ripped straight from The Return Of The Jedi (Snoke trying to convert Rey) and The Enpire Strikes Back (the trench warfare on the Salt Planet at the end).

In the end, Rian Johnson had some great ideas in this film, but just couldn't execute. Rian Johnson is a great director when you watch his films, but he is weak as a writer. A failure of execution, pacing, and character development made me give this movie a One Star Rating. I would've rated it lower if I didn't like Rian Johnson's previous works.

"December 24, 2017","The shine wears off from this film very quickly. There are many things in this film that won't stand up to the test of time and audiences won't be watching The Last Jedi in 20 years time still in gasping awe. 

The films comedy falls flat and is inconsistant with most of the film. The pacing is wrong. This is another block buster movie to cut pivotel story telling moments in order to fill in time with a superfluous sub plot. 

There is even an incredibly nauseating love speech with plunges The lAst Jedi down to the depths of day time soap operas.

"December 24, 2017","NO SPOILERS: Every moment of this film is bold, leaving no room for middling opinions. This film is so surprisingly divisive because there's no safe formula to lean back on when things get crazy. And things do get crazy. I love most of it, and even the things I dislike I can still appreciate for being so ambitious in a mainstream big-budget-blockbuster movie. The things I dislike I'm even coming around to after repeated viewings and meditations. There are many moments that are better than anything else in the saga. Every scene, every set-piece is made with such clear love of the lore, with all of its weirdness. Anyone who was worried about the Porgs can rest easy, they are much less in the way than Ewoks. They only ever have a quick couple of asides, then we're right back to the action. If this really is the direction that Disney/Lucasfilm wants to take Star Wars' future, I am all in.

SPOILERS: The only things that didn't really do it for me were Superman Leia and Holdo's characterisation. I understand that her contentiousness as an authority figure was an important dynamic for Poe to learn from, but we needed a reason that she wasn't telling her plan to anyone. I think it would've even added more tension if the audience is told that Holdo had a better plan in motion that was being destroyed by Poe and Finn's plan. Whether she believed there was a mole, or she had the same ""need-to-know"" logic as Poe had, we needed a line in there to explain her unwillingness to tell the Resistance what her plan was.

Superman Leia I think is a good idea in premise, but the execution looked a little silly. The music was absolutely outstanding in this moment, so I'm sure it will become more forgivable on rewatch.

Speaking of music, my favourite part of the movie was the Millenium Falcon chase through the salt caves on Crait. That was the best use of that classic Falcon theme in the entire saga. It feels like a rollercoaster ride to watch every time.

Canto Bight is mixed for me. I love it, but at the same time there are parts where the tension of the Resistance's situation isn't quite felt by Finn and Rose's detour.

Finn and Rose... Finn was definitely not interested when Rose kissed him. I hope that's dealt with appropriately in IX.

The Knights of Ren are forgivably absent in this film, but I hope they are major players in IX.

The humour is hit and miss, but mostly hit for me. I wish Luke throwing the lightsaber wasn't played as much for laughs, but the interplay between Poe and Hux was brilliant.

Phasma apparently has a deleted scene where she shoots a group of Stormtroopers so that she can try to escape. I'm very disappointed this was cut, it would have framed her character very well. I hope that the CGI was completed on this scene, because I'll definitely be reintergrating it in my copy.

Kylo Ren is perfect. He and Rey continue to be the shining stars of this trilogy.

Snoke was a very obvious weak link in The Force Awakens, so I'm glad Johnson recognised this and dealt accordingly in what was in my opinion the best way possible. I'm slightly disappointed by the lack of even a simple backstory for him. Just something to explain the gap in the timeline where he was apparently not doing anything, then suddenly became involved in this group of characters; would've been nice, but I'd much prefer just getting rid of him. And Johnson did so in a way that made Kylo Ren even more compelling. Brilliant.

Throw your expectations out the window. You won't need them, and looking at all the butt-hurt negative reviews that are disappointed because their Snoke and Rey theories aren't correct, you won't want them.

Character and themes take the forefront here, every movement of the plot is designed to help our main characters learn the lessons they need to propel them to where they need to be in IX. Every scene just felt like pure Star Wars. Dialled up to 11.

It's the near-perfect middle chapter for this trilogy, and the closest to perfection Star Wars has gotten since 1980.

"December 24, 2017","I thought The Last Jedi was great. Finally we get to see something original and refreshing! Something that wasn't just another copy and paste story being reused because of its popularity and promise of nostalgia. The Last Jedi takes the series in a new and unforeseen direction we (the audience) didn't see coming, and in a time when Hollywood is filled to the brim with studios producing nothing but financially safe reboots, that surprise is something to be celebrated!!! How could anyone like The Force Awakens over something that was actually new and original! That movie had nothing new to give to us. Why bother if you've seen and heard the same story before!?

1) Underdeveloped characters, too many characters, lack of character arcs which mean that what characters do in this film don't make sense.

2) Constantly building up a situation only for it to be knocked down. This isn't big, it isn't clever and when it happens constantly it makes the film totally underwhelming.

3) Terrible, lame humour, badly timed. Urgh.

4) The killing off of key characters without reason, logic or care.

5) The film felt like it was making fun of Star Wars and its fans. I'm surprised a caption didn't appear at the end of the film saying ""Ha! Did you like Star Wars..... I bet you don't anymore - loser!!""",0.5, Helen S

"December 24, 2017","This review contains spoilers so beware if you are going to read further.

Rian delivers a story that is unexpected but wrong, not right. It acts as anthology movie rather than part of trilogy. In the beginning of the movie Luke throws away the lightsaber Rey gives him. It is kind of symbolic to what this movie does to previous 8 movies. (counting Rogue One).

Rian throws away established mythology by George Lucas, destroys Luke Skywalker character, ignores JJ Abrams' afford in Ep VII to create new mysteries and evolve stories that had potential in Ep VIII. The movie has lot of plot holes and it misses logic here and there. 

The movie showed that nobody needs to train to be master of the Jedi craft. To use force, to swing lightsaber as a pro, to know how to swim even though you lived on the desert planet your whole life. Rian simply ignores George fundamentals of to be a Jedi and use the force one needs to take a lot of training to be one. 

What is wrong:

Rey - without training happen to master Jedi craft within a week counting EP VII too. 

Phasma - wasted potential and underused character.

Rose and Finn subplot - takes too long, un-logical

Lea - a scene where we discovers she knows and uses the force is straight Superman scene. You can believe Superman but you will not believe Lea here. It does not feel right.

Admiral Holdo - shady character to be revealed she had plan all the time. I love the scene where she lightspeed through the First Order fleet.

The First Order - chasing few ships like they can not take out all those ships with fighters.

Luke - Mark Hamill delivers the best performance here and he himself does not agree with this Luke. Luke is broken and turns his back on his sister, Chewie, dead Han and the dying good??? Really??? This is not Luke we know and it does not make sense. His self exile should have served a better purpose. We could have seen the best Luke, have further knowledge of Jedi history, discover their training and see how Luke manages to find a new way how to train Jedi and kind of fix the problems Jedi had during their time. Instead we get this Luke that in the end decides to once again ""save"" rebellion without telling Poe and others to go I will hold them off. It takes Poe to realise what Luke is up to???

Snoke - lot of questions unanswered, wasted potential, mysterious character that could have shown more of his powers. Nobody explains him where he comes from how he changed Ben to Kylo. We haven't even seen his training Snoke pointed in the end of EPVII. Yet I love the betrayal scene. That was epic and right.

The final act and battle is not a battle as it turns out. Luke just shows and hold off Kylo. Instead coming in his X-Wing, cause some damage to walkers and help get rest of Resistance now Rebellion again on the Falcon. Since Carrie Fisher passed away it would make more sense for him to be in the EP IX alive and help build the Rebellion. Here reshoots should have been made. 

Humour in this movie is overdone and not humorous in some scenes like Finn waking up, Hux and Poe chat taking too long, It is really forced and opening battle where the asian girl is kicking the ladder to drop the button... the whole heavy bombers feel wrong. It would be really dark movie if it has less forced humour and went to the mind of dark lord and showed some Kylo Ren meditation to Vader or some of that as we have not seen it in any movie before.

This could have been a lot better logical movie and the best Star Wars movie if it explored more of light and dark side of the force and mythology, showed mastered Luke Skywalker training Rey in new ways returning as Master and Padawan. Better explaining how Snoke was influencing Kylo and turning him to the Dark Side and explaining how the First Order came back from the ashes of Empire and where is Snoke from and how he is so strong with the force. Who was Max Von Sydow and why he has the map. Why R2D2 woke up from the hibernation mode at the moment as he did and showed the larger map? It all could have had a higher better meaning as it created a huge potential. 

No, simply no. The director just throws it away. Sad you cant throw away EP VIII. Critics love it fans are divided by it. If you ask me why are fans divided I would say it is because those who did not like the movie were the ones like Mark Hamill kind of guys and others were more mediocre average Star Wars fans who just do not care that much about all that Star Wars is.

What was good:

Falcon fighting TIE fighters, Kylo Ren, Porgs, Chewie, Lea, Poe, Holdo's sacrifice, Phasma vs Finn, DJ, C3PO, visual and sound effects, excellent soundtrack by John Williams far better than EP VII.

PS: Look at all the explaining Rian Johnson had to do after the movie was released. The movie is bad as sequel and Star Wars movie. What Rian did with this movie is catastrophic as it does not respect George mythology and foundations of Star Wars universe of Jedi, Sith, force and JJ Abrams' effort. Yet the movie is a good quality visually and atmospherically. I believe his own trilogy would make more sense rather than this movie.",2, Mario P
"December 24, 2017","A fun and OK movie, not a great Star Wars movie. The story is all over the place and it just seems like they try too hard to make it funny and different. Bad structure and writing is at the heart of this film.

"December 24, 2017","Being a movie lover and a writer, you go in a cinema with higher expectations and a different view then your average movie goer. so when i got the chance to see this film on its opening weekend, I was so excited! But unfortunately for me and a lot of Star Wars, and genuine movie fans we were let down. This 8th film in the franchise feels and views nothing like its predecessors. The film lacks in every aspect. It continuously changes its genre from being a drama, action, comedy... Its

flow always get broken up, and is always all over the place.

Then there is the whole scenes and unnecessary plot adjustments that dont make sense. The characters are becoming so ridiculous and pointless at the same time. Finn has no character progression what so ever. Ray literally had no training in the Jedi ways, as she never even had her 3rd lesson with skywalker, but took on the red guards and Kylo Ren. 

Not to mention Luke (him selves) has done a complete 180 turn to what his character was in the original films. Luke Skywalker opened up and nearly had the most corrupted Sith kill him as he converted Darth Vader to the light side. Luke was the beacon and the most pure association of hope, but in this film they make his character completely different, which doesn't make sense. 

I just don't want to even mention Chewy or Snoke. Why were they in the film? They added or did nothing to the story, replace them with another character and nothing changes. The rebels are still being chased by the Order, Kylo is still bed, Rey is still ""learning"" and everything remained the same.

I feel like I can write a whole essay on all the different levels this film failed. Story line, character development, terrible dialogue, complete waste of scenes. The Casino part was the worst.

I just hope that J.J can at least do some damage control in the third film. 

The only good thing about is the visual effects. This film felt like Guardians of the Galaxy or super hero film rather then Star Wars film.",1.5, Movie G

"December 24, 2017","I don't understand how this film was made. Reading the high critical reviews which cannot highlight any actual pros to this movie and ignore critical plot holes or character association, along with its huge incongruence with the audience score suggest that Disney or at least Lucasfilm has paid a number of these critics in advance to artificially inflate the score. The only redeeming scenes were those of Carrie Fisher (may she rest in peace after how this movie disgracing her legacy), and the shot with the boulders where Oscar Isaac's and John Boyega's character appear to hold hands. I speculate they did this after facing much resistance. As a fan, I would like a explanations and apologies from Kathleen Kennedy (who should be fired for allowing Johnson's racist attempts at white feminism and sexist/misogynistic character assassination of Rey in this film, among other issues), Rian Johnson (who should be stricken from pursuing a SW trilogy without even having a plot, much like this film), Lucasfilm (how were these people ever approved), and Disney.

It's profoundly conflicting, as I enjoyed every second of the story inside a universe I adore. But Johnson's callous treatment of our character icons and the galaxy we love, is reckless, despicable and categorically unforgivable.

"December 24, 2017","Disappointing character evolutions and arcs render the plot borderline silly and purposeless during significant sequences of the film. Misplaced humor - due to timing, tone, and even technological antiquity (leave a message lame comment from Poe to Hux) felt insincere and forced as opposed to the quick sarcastic, albeit cheesy spat that made the originals appealing and sincere. More importantly, Star Wars has ALWAYS focused on the hero's journey - the failures, the successes, the flaws, the strengths, the fear, the confidence, the love, and the love - all of the complex mental, emotional, and spiritual polarities that exist within the hero (and even villain, in some cases) that manifest in the form of physical tribulations and challenges that are overcome or failed. This is precisely where TLJ fails. Rey; our primary hero, is the same basic character we saw in TFA, though she has some new abilities and the viewer has a slightly better glimpse of her potential as a Jedi but not as an actual being, as someone undergoing profound changes and upheavals to become great. In order for that to happen, failure of the greatest order must be witnessed by the viewer to make the transformation believable. Otherwise, we are simply watching the aftermath of a character's arrival to greatness.. The first two films failed to establish this necessary arc and thus far only Kylo Ren is the only character who has experienced any significant evolutionary conflict that propels the plot. Finn has his original moment in TFA when he makes his most critical character choice, but since that moment, his character has been stifled by erratic, unnecessary plot devices that revolves around the silly notion that the entire Resistance Movement might actually come down to needing a gas station and Keanu Reeves in Speed to keep the primary spaceship from stopping, ever - as if it couldn't be surrounded. All of this is happening as Finn's potential as a transformative character vanish in a series of sub-plot lines that actually don't advance the main plot in a cohesive manner. Like Rey, it feels like Finn is the same character he was in TFA, which means the storytelling failed. The same is true of every character is the movie, even Luke - despite what some reviewers are suggesting. It's one thing to create a new string within the Star Wars Universe, but when that string unravels three of the top films in the franchise via the central protagonist, that's usually shortcut storytelling that ultimately wants to shift its focus to the future before a natural progression transpires with a new plot device to supplant the old device - or at least connect it. The Luke plot line in TFA and TLJ doesn't mesh well with the mythos of Luke's character arc, and not does his dialogue in TLJ come close to mirroring anything remotely Luke-like. Luke's send off in TLJ is nothing more than a ""okay, it's time - we want to go in a new direction, even though we aren't quite sure where, just not here."" Luke really teaches Rey almost nothing. She barely has an emotional reaction when he dies, the same is true for Leia. Eh, another bites the dust - like Han. If you enjoy action without purpose with some cool scenes, this is the right flick. If you enjoy storytelling with multiple connected character arcs that tell several cohesive stories within the one palatable universal story of the Force and life and how it is all connected and where it goes and how it happens ... Re-watch the original Teilogy or Lost or Indiana Jones or something else because TLJ has all the glam but little substance",2, Jeremy W

Just one examples... If ships in star wars have no defence what so ever against other small ships moving at light speed then why even bother building the Death Star, just shoot things (ships/planets) with x-wings at light speed and the galaxy is on its knees. Stupid, stupid writing.

Seems like no thought was given to the state of the galaxy. Where did the First Order come from? Wasnt the Republic supposed to be in charge for the last 30-40 years?

"December 24, 2017","The film is a huge disappointment to me primarily because of its portrayal of Luke Skywalker, who is unrecognisable compared to the character of the original trilogy. An utter betrayal of the character for no reason. Also, the central plot is poor, with key sub plots and character actions becoming pointless or worse by the end, the continued miraculous display of Force skill with no training by Rey is ridiculous and lazy.Power and innate ability does not equal control and skill. I like the character, but it is dumb and undermines her. The complete lack of explanation of key characters and developments is also utterly unsatisfactory. Why has Rian Johnson and Disney destroyed and made pointless the actions and successes of the Rebel Alliance and original characters? To provide this half baked rubbish? We lost the Canon of the extended universe for what? A major part of what I loved about the original films, and even the disappointing prequels, was the presence of a discernable longer story arc, which is completely lacking in these new films in their eagerness to pump them out as fast as possible and print money. Extremely and desperately disappointed.",2, Nikolas H
"December 24, 2017","I loved this movie for precisely the reasons that the haters hated it. A complex compelling story which brought the franchise bang up to date in terms of diversity, story and the shades of grey in real life. No, Luke isn't the same as he was in the original trilogy and was all the better for it. The Whole franchise has looked at complex narratives like GOT and brought us an epic space opera with heart, soul and brains.

TLJ isn't perfect. I agree that we don't find out enough about Snoke or Phasma, but in a movie stuffed to the hilt with great moments I understand there just wasn't room. Rey and Kylo are the main protagonists and it was right to focus on them.

I've yet to meet anyone who hasn't loved this movie, so I', not sure which planet the haters are living on. Possibly the planet COD from the language used.

I'll be more than happy if the trolls keep away from future installments, but they'll still go so they can spout their hatred and feel important about themselves.",5, John H

"December 24, 2017","I did not like this film. Luke's character was someone altogether different from the Luke we knew in the previous episodes. It would have been better if they used a different actor, not because of the acting, Mark was great, but because the characterization was so wrong, it wasn't Luke at all. 

I felt like this film just didn't have heart. When Luke died there was no emotional impact, I think partly because how he was portrayed, and partly because the story sucked. Snoke is some powerful master, yet you know NOTHING about him and he lasted 5 minutes. 

This was the Star Wars version of a Michael Bay film, lot's of shiny explosive things, and little plot or character development. I looked at my watch several times wondering how much longer it was going to be. How did Rian Johnson get an entire trilogy based on this movie?? What a waste of this franchise and the actors.

"December 24, 2017","Rotten Tomato Movie Review: The Last Jedi

Did not enjoy The Last Jedi as much as I wanted to.

I had to been looking forward to this film since The Force Awakens 2 years ago.

I was so excited about Star Wars again that when they announced a stand alone film called Rogue One... I couldn't wait to get back into the Star Wars world. So when Christmas of 2016 rolled around, I jumped at the chance to watch Rogue One, hoping to keep being beguiled by that Star Wars giddy feeling. 

That emotional stir of someone caught in a fantastical space soap opera. Spinning and dancing with that crackling crash of light sabers! Dodging and ducking the zooming swoosh of light speed space ships tangled in an epic battle between good and evil.

However, Rogue One wasn't the film I was expecting it to be. So I patiently waited, like most of us fans for The Last Jedi.

It was a loooong year. It was to be the highlight to my year.

Unfortunately, it wasn't the film I had hoped it would be.

Watching The Last Jedi shook my confidence in the whole Star Wars world so much I didn't know why I felt so empty.

So I did what most fans do. I actually rewatched The Empire Strikes Back just to compare it to this new sequel.

Upon re-watching The Empire Strikes Back, my mind became clearer.

What I discovered was that this 1980 film wasn't all it was made out to be. For a start it had a lot of slow bits. And there were plot lines that seemed to make little sense.

The Empire Strikes Back turned out to be unevenly paced and illogical on many levels. Right from the start, Luke was out in the middle of the snow for no apparent reason. Han Solo just announces he needs to take off due to some bounty on his head or some such. Yet we forgave it because in 1980, you tended to forgive blockbuster films for being huge plot-hole monsters with explosions to make up for the lack of finesse and elegance of smaller more well-thought-out films.

These days we want the big films to have it all. We want them to be plotted well. We want great acting. We even demand clear character arcs/journeys. And we want the explosions to boot.

For my money, I had more thrills watching smaller budget films like The Foreigner with Jackie Chan or found more charm in the modestly budgeted Paddington 2 than this $250 million dollar marketing machine.

I will admit, my love for the Star Wars universe will never die. However, I feel a bit like that kid who has to wake up to the realisation that Christmas will never be the same once you admit that Santa Claus is just a man in a red suit. He has no powers. He doesn't read our wish list letters. He doesn't gobble up 100 million cookies in one night without suffering diabetes or a cardiac arrest. It doesn't take away the warmth of being with our loved ones... but it takes away the sparkle in our eyes when we stop believing in flying reindeer or gifts created just for us made by loyal caring elves in the north pole.

So there it is. I still admire the film makers for doing an incredible job of taking us to another universe. But it's just not the Star Wars that kept me glued to the screen as a child. It's become a well designed bit of fantasy fluff. Just not an imaginary world where we can be sword fighting rebels who move objects with our minds and inspire legions of rebels to triumph. It's just kind of above average... with a killer musical score by legendary John Williams.

The villain isn't even as captivating. The heroes are rather forgettable. And the battles are predictably high budget spectacles that don't linger in my mind. Not sure if I'll even look forward to the 3rd film... I appreciate the effort. Close but no cigar for this Star Wars fan. May the Force be with you indeed.",3, Jaeson I
"December 24, 2017","I'm a 39 year old life long Star Wars fan. I've seen every movie in the series many many times: prequels, original cuts, and the re-releases. I've read countless extended universe books (they should have just done the Thrawn Trilogy!) I've likely played every officially licensed Star Wars game (RGP, board/miniature game, video game, etc.). I am deeply knowledgeable of the lore that makes the series truly great. Star Wars was a huge part of my childhood, and it is something which even as an adult with three children is still a big deal for me. I've now watched TLJ several times and I'm ready to share my insights on this highly polarizing episode. 

[SPOILERS AHEAD!]

Let me start by saying Rian Johnson should NEVER be allowed to write a single line for another Star Wars movie, much less do a whole new trilogy of movies. How does someone with such a poor resume get the execs at Disney to let them even ATTEMPT to take on this challenge? What kind of pitch could someone give to write AND direct such important and valuable IP when they essentially have the equivalent experience of writing two episodes of LA Law, directing Deathstalker V, and a doing poorly received arthouse flick? He must have some profound connections, or a whole lot of dirt on someone. His prime directive appears to be this: destroy everything sacred in the Star Wars universe, make TFA entirely pointless, and raise two middle fingers to everyone who doesn't like it. Some sick combination of jealousy and narcissism apparently made him want to set J.J. Abrams up for failure: Episode IX is the movie that is going to see the HUGE box office drop due to the pointless fan slapping done in this film. TFA was great, the buzz for the next installment was unbelievable. The Internet was wild with rumors and theories and hope for the next installment. Many people (myself included) bought tickets for TLJ months in advance... which meant sold out theaters and a huge opening weekend no matter what. Rian knew he could do whatever he wanted and still walk away claiming it was a big success based on that data alone. Well, the capital built in TFA is now wasted after TLJ. Episode IX will not be seeing the same fan surge this film undeservedly received.

Big Issues: 

- Snoke: Who the hell ""was"" he? How did he get this job? Was he just the most scarred dude around? Did he simply have the most fascist followers on Space Twitter? Why have him in the films in the first place if you cannot even justify his purpose? A few lines of dialog were _all it took_ to make sense out of this. Ignoring character exposition with the excuse that Lucas didn't explain the Emperor until the prequels is bogus. We saw the prequels to these films... all SIX OF THEM. He didn't just poof into existence and rule the galaxy. Give me a break man! All that time hoping his projected image from TFA was a Wizard of Oz created by a dark and twisted Jar-Jar Binks. Oh well... Snoke is gone now and seemed to have no point whatsoever.

- Knights Of Ren: Where are they? Are they also pointless now? Is whiny Emo Ren the only Sith left on the board? 

- Superman Leia?! WTF was that... I kept waiting for Poe to quote that terrible dialog from the cringeworthy Matrix sequel.

- Luke... good lord, I don't know where to even begin. Let's just say ROTJ and even TFA didn't leave me thinking I was going to see my hero become a washed up loser drinking milk from some space walrus' tit. Also, the portrayal of this character was an entirely pointless slap in the face of every fan of the original trilogy. Rian could have got the same meta story across without being such a jackass. This is just Rian Johnson giving us the finger and laughing.

- Kylo Ren: This guy has burned the Jedi Academy to the ground, murdered his own family, killed his Sith master, and assumed control of the First Order. Yet somehow he is still a whiny little b*tch. Please give me a worthy antagonist which isn't a sad little emo man-child. PLEASE! 

The Non-Issues:

A number of user reviews seem to be seething with political nonsense. I totally understand that 2017 is beginning of some kind of ""age of outrage"". The US is fuming with extremists on each side, who are pissing off everyone else across the political spectrum on a daily (if not hourly) basis. I am confident that all the dog-whistles people are perceiving are more a projection of how they see the world (and see those who oppose whatever their views are) in light of all the heightened polarization today. Criticism that this movie is anti-men, because of the (absolutely amazing!) female leads is totally disgusting. You could level the same criticism at A Nightmare On Elm Street 3. How about ""all rich people are evil"" - go watch Toxic Avenger through that lens and get your mind blown. Carefully hidden PETA-like messaging triggering you? Don't even think of watching The Secret of NIMH again. Ruining your childhood much? Just enjoy the damn movie and don't get hung up looking for political things. If you look hard enough you'll find hidden messages everywhere, and never be able to enjoy anything.

The Good:

All that said, there are some big picture ideas and frameworks (which likely pre-date Rian's involvement) and do in a meta-sense make this a not-so-terrible (possibly even pretty decent) film.

The future of the Force and the meaning of this awakening is cemented in this film. Much of the back and forth with Kylo and Rey touch on an odd idea. Could the Force be beyond good and evil / light and dark. Did Skywalker bloodline bring ""balance to the force""... by destroying the Jedi Order AND The Sith? Not a balance of light vs. dark, but a new balance of light and dark into one? We watch as the old established orders meet their end. The orthodox religion of the force dies with Luke in the shadow of the first Jedi temple. A new religion, understanding, being-ness of the Force is about to take hold on the galaxy.

Failure itself is a huge message in this film. Every sub plot in the film totally failed, and did so _intentionally_ to drive the message home that failure is a greater teacher then success. That the true legacy of the Jedi, Sith, Empire, and Rebels was failure after failure to bring peace and/or order to the galaxy. Something has to change, and I think we are seeing hints of that in this film. 

The final scene was epic. I certainly have friends who disagree, but the passing of the torch to a new generation without the orthodoxy, rigor, and establishment of the previous Jedi Order is a big deal. This is a new religion of the Force being written -- one without books and teachers. One which has to be experienced and developed by new chosen disciples. I was one of those fans who really hated how the prequels moved the Force from being a tremendous supernatural Zen/Tao-like power flowing through all things and open to anyone... to being a product of microscopic intelligent parasites living in the blood of a chosen few. Midi-chlorian blood tests be damned, I want the Force to be a mystical energy once again. I hope this ""awakening"" now means everyone may be able to tap into the Force without being born into it with the right bloodline, or just by having a nasty parasite infection. It appears that may be the case as the Force itself is reaching out and mystically choosing a new legion of force users to replace the old generation. Speculation maybe, but I have hope.

Incredible visuals, a beautiful score, and great art direction help pull this movie out of splatty tomato territory in my book. Even if it doesn't feel Star Wars-y enough for my tastes this time around, and suffered from some slow pacing, it did what it needed to do in order to take us to the next step on this journey. I'm excited and hopeful for the conclusion to this arc, and what it means for the franchise. Rian certainly did his best to burn it all down, but he can't kill Star Wars so easily. Hopefully, Disney will listen to the millions of die-hard fans and take better care with the next installment(s).",3.5, Gregory H

"December 24, 2017","The force is a balance between the light and the dark, and the light eventually wins. What a perfect metaphor for The Last Jedi, a balance between great scenes and stupid shit, which won my affection in the end.

I'm late to this party, so you already know the stupid shit. The side quest within a side quest to the casino planet was annoying and pointless. There wasn't any way to get Rose and Finn aboard Snoke's ship other than that overlong and idiotic excursion? It had George Lucas episode 1 written all over it. Speaking of Rose, what was the point of her? I found her irritating and a distraction for Finn, who already has two love interests. How did Rose and Finn become such good speeder pilots so quickly? And why didn't the Vice-Admiral decide to turn the cruiser around and jump a bit sooner, before there were only about 5 transports left? Finally, what happened to the rest of the Resistance ground fighters at the end? I don't think they all made it into the Falcon.

All of that vexation aside (and it's a lot, and there's more), the overall story arc was quite good, Rey and Luke together were amusing and strong, and Kylo Ren becoming the new Supreme Leader was the biggest and most welcome change from the original trilogy. They heard fans appreciate the humor from episode VII, so more was added here, pushing some moments as far as continuity would allow, particularly with Luke.

I want to learn how to force-project myself, a new but logical conception here, because you can make yourself look younger and with a better haircut. I don't have any idea what will happen in episode IX, which is a welcome feeling after too much repetition in this series.",3.5, Bob K

After seeing this film with friends on opening night I was not looking forward to taking my family to see it the following day but I had already purchased the tickets or I wouldn't have seen it the next day again. Disney apparently lacked confidence in their ability to move the story forward for new characters without destroying the old characters. I was a fan of Rey after ""The Force Awakens"", you didn't need to destroy my childhood hero to make room for her...how insecure in your abilities to write a good story around these new characters are you?

How does someone with such a poor resume get the execs at Disney to let them even ATTEMPT to take on this challenge? What kind of pitch could someone give to write AND direct such important and valuable IP when they essentially have the equivalent experience of writing two episodes of LA Law, directing Deathstalker V, and a doing poorly received arthouse flick? He must have some profound connections, or a whole lot of dirt on someone. His prime directive appears to be this: destroy everything sacred in the Star Wars universe, make TFA entirely pointless, and raise two middle fingers to everyone who doesn't like it. Some sick combination of jealousy and narcissism apparently made him want to set J.J. Abrams up for failure: Episode IX is the movie that is going to see the HUGE box office drop due to the pointless fan slapping done in this film. TFA was great, the buzz for the next installment was unbelievable. The Internet was wild with rumors and theories and hope for the next installment. Many people (myself included) bought tickets for TLJ months in advance... which meant sold out theaters and a huge opening weekend no matter what. Rian knew he could do whatever he wanted and still walk away claiming it was a big success based on that data alone. Well, the capital built in TFA is now wasted after TLJ. Episode IX will not be seeing the same fan surge this film undeservedly received.

Big Issues: 

- Snoke: Who the hell ""was"" he? How did he get this job? Was he just the most scarred dude around? Did he simply have the most fascist followers on Space Twitter? Why have him in the films in the first place if you cannot even justify his purpose? A few lines of dialog were _all it took_ to make sense out of this. Ignoring character exposition with the excuse that Lucas didn't explain the Emperor until the prequels is bogus. We saw the prequels to these films... all SIX OF THEM. He didn't just poof into existence and rule the galaxy. Give me a break man! All that time hoping his projected image from TFA was a Wizard of Oz created by a dark and twisted Jar-Jar Binks. Oh well... Snoke is gone now and seemed to have no point whatsoever.

- Knights Of Ren: Where are they? Are they also pointless now? Is whiny Emo Ren the only Sith left on the board? 

- Superman Leia?! WTF was that... I kept waiting for Poe to quote that terrible dialog from the cringeworthy Matrix sequel.

- Luke... good lord, I don't know where to even begin. Let's just say ROTJ and even TFA didn't leave me thinking I was going to see my hero become a washed up loser drinking milk from some space walrus' tit. Also, the portrayal of this character was an entirely pointless slap in the face of every fan of the original trilogy. Rian could have got the same meta story across without being such a jackass. This is just Rian Johnson giving us the finger and laughing.

- Kylo Ren: This guy has burned the Jedi Academy to the ground, murdered his own family, killed his Sith master, and assumed control of the First Order. Yet somehow he is still a whiny little b*tch. Please give me a worthy antagonist which isn't a sad little emo man-child. PLEASE! 

The Non-Issues:

A number of user reviews seem to be seething with political nonsense. I totally understand that 2017 is beginning of some kind of ""age of outrage"". The US is fuming with extremists on each side, who are pissing off everyone else across the political spectrum on a daily (if not hourly) basis. I am confident that all the dog-whistles people are perceiving are more a projection of how they see the world (and see those who oppose whatever their views are) in light of all the heightened polarization today. Criticism that this movie is anti-men, because of the (absolutely amazing!) female leads is totally disgusting. You could level the same criticism at A Nightmare On Elm Street 3. How about ""all rich people are evil"" - go watch Toxic Avenger through that lens and get your mind blown. Carefully hidden PETA-like messaging triggering you? Don't even think of watching The Secret of NIMH again. Ruining your childhood much? Just enjoy the damn movie and don't get hung up looking for political things. If you look hard enough you'll find hidden messages everywhere, and never be able to enjoy anything.

The Good:

All that said, there are some big picture ideas and frameworks (which likely pre-date Rian's involvement) and do in a meta-sense make this a not-so-terrible (possibly even pretty decent) film.

The future of the Force and the meaning of this awakening is cemented in this film. Much of the back and forth with Kylo and Rey touch on an odd idea. Could the Force be beyond good and evil / light and dark. Did Skywalker bloodline bring ""balance to the force""... by destroying the Jedi Order AND The Sith? Not a balance of light vs. dark, but a new balance of light and dark into one? We watch as the old established orders meet their end. The orthodox religion of the force dies with Luke in the shadow of the first Jedi temple. A new religion, understanding, being-ness of the Force is about to take hold on the galaxy.

Failure itself is a huge message in this film. Every sub plot in the film totally failed, and did so _intentionally_ to drive the message home that failure is a greater teacher then success. That the true legacy of the Jedi, Sith, Empire, and Rebels was failure after failure to bring peace and/or order to the galaxy. Something has to change, and I think we are seeing hints of that in this film. 

The final scene was epic. I certainly have friends who disagree, but the passing of the torch to a new generation without the orthodoxy, rigor, and establishment of the previous Jedi Order is a big deal. This is a new religion of the Force being written -- one without books and teachers. One which has to be experienced and developed by new chosen disciples. I was one of those fans who really hated how the prequels moved the Force from being a tremendous supernatural Zen/Tao-like power flowing through all things and open to anyone... to being a product of microscopic intelligent parasites living in the blood of a chosen few. Midi-chlorian blood tests be damned, I want the Force to be a mystical energy once again. I hope this ""awakening"" now means everyone may be able to tap into the Force without being born into it with the right bloodline, or just by having a nasty parasite infection. It appears that may be the case as the Force itself is reaching out and mystically choosing a new legion of force users to replace the old generation. Speculation maybe, but I have hope.

Incredible visuals, a beautiful score, and great art direction help pull this movie out of splatty tomato territory in my book. Even if it doesn't feel Star Wars-y enough for my tastes this time around, and suffered from some slow pacing, it did what it needed to do in order to take us to the next step on this journey. I'm excited and hopeful for the conclusion to this arc, and what it means for the franchise. Rian certainly did his best to burn it all down, but he can't kill Star Wars so easily. Hopefully, Disney will listen to the millions of die-hard fans and take better care with the next installment(s).",3.5, Gregory H

"December 24, 2017",the movie is beautifully done but the plot is weak and no character development ... so long for actually nothing ..and above all leia version of superman was just too much..and luke willing to kill a child??no way...maybe this new trilogy is meant for young audience cause now i feel like i watch new star wars just because i have to .. ..,0.5, Chiara A
"December 24, 2017","The force is a balance between the light and the dark, and the light eventually wins. What a perfect metaphor for The Last Jedi, a balance between great scenes and stupid shit, which won my affection in the end.

I'm late to this party, so you already know the stupid shit. The side quest within a side quest to the casino planet was annoying and pointless. There wasn't any way to get Rose and Finn aboard Snoke's ship other than that overlong and idiotic excursion? It had George Lucas episode 1 written all over it. Speaking of Rose, what was the point of her? I found her irritating and a distraction for Finn, who already has two love interests. How did Rose and Finn become such good speeder pilots so quickly? And why didn't the Vice-Admiral decide to turn the cruiser around and jump a bit sooner, before there were only about 5 transports left? Finally, what happened to the rest of the Resistance ground fighters at the end? I don't think they all made it into the Falcon.

All of that vexation aside (and it's a lot, and there's more), the overall story arc was quite good, Rey and Luke together were amusing and strong, and Kylo Ren becoming the new Supreme Leader was the biggest and most welcome change from the original trilogy. They heard fans appreciate the humor from episode VII, so more was added here, pushing some moments as far as continuity would allow, particularly with Luke.

I want to learn how to force-project myself, a new but logical conception here, because you can make yourself look younger and with a better haircut. I don't have any idea what will happen in episode IX, which is a welcome feeling after too much repetition in this series.",3.5, Bob K
"December 24, 2017","I really don't see what the critics like about this film. Poor pacing, bad story lines, misused established characters, misused new characters.

Killing off established characters, killing off newly introduced characters, the plot holes, my GOD the plot holes. 

This movie has turned Star Wars from a cinema experience for me to a rental, and with the way critics are falling over themselves to not piss off Disney I'll never trust a Rotten Tomatoes score again.",0.5, David C
"December 24, 2017","Disappointment doesn't begin to describe my experience in watching this film. Rian Johnson's depiction and treatment of Luke was very disheartening. I would strongly dispute Mr. Johnson's claim that he is a Star Wars fan. I share many of the same opinions regarding Luke already shared here and agree with Mark Hamill's comments regarding his thoughts on how Luke was portrayed. For the first time ever I'm not looking forward to future installments of my once favorite series. After seeing this film with friends on opening night I was not looking forward to taking my family to see it the following day but I had already purchased the tickets or I wouldn't have seen it the next day again. Disney apparently lacked confidence in their ability to move the story forward for new characters without destroying the old characters. I was a fan of Rey after ""The Force Awakens"", you didn't need to destroy my childhood hero to make room for her...how insecure in your abilities to write a good story around these new characters are you? Disney has ruined my experience with Star Wars and for the first time ever I could care less about what's next for Star Wars...",0.5, 
"December 24, 2017","This is a terrible movie. Even if it didn't completely break the lore of Star Wars, this movie is simply full of lazy writing and does almost nothing. Its a beautiful, stunning movie, so its easy to get lost in the awe of Star Wars as pretty, but pretty doesn't make a good movie. Things happen in the movie because they are forced to happen that way, and the resolution is bland and without any heroic or anti-heroic payoff. No one faces anyone of consequence. Its flashy lights and people whining. I just don't know how this movie made it past any screenings without someone questioning WTF was going on.",1, Alan G
"December 24, 2017","I don't understand why critics are giving it a 9 out of 10. I found the plot to be really dumb and the plot threads to be confusing. Characters were shallow, dialogue was like reading a script, and everyone just seemed to be trying to ride on the ""Star Wars"" name. I could talk for hours about my issues with the film (which I have) but I wanted to make my first ever Rotten Tomatoes score JUST BECAUSE I felt there is no way this should be getting 92%. This is heading towards prequel levels in terms of quality.",2, Hugh T
"December 24, 2017",Disney's Star Wars is now officially terrible.,1, 
"December 24, 2017","Easily the worst Star Wars movie made thus far. So much terrible, try-hard, humor that is completely uncharacteristic of the Star Wars franchise. The plot jumps all over the place with MANY happenings left unexplained about about 30 plot holes I can think of off the top of my head. I have been a huge Star Wars fan my entire life, and I actually considered walking out because it was that terrible. This movie accomplished pretty much nothing, and it's apparent that Disney wants to make as many ""cute"" sellable creatures for marketing and money purposes. The new creatures look more like something from a fairy princess movie than Star Wars. Lastly, Kylo Ren has proven himself to be a very weak villain, and I don't see how it's possible the next movie will be any good with such a weak, emotionally-driven villain. I know most Star Wars fans will see it, as I did, with low expectations to begin with, but WOW believe me when I say, you cannot set your expectations low enough. This movie is a hot pile of trash.",2, Stefanie S

"December 24, 2017",Some of the plot made no sense. The direction made with some the characters were not the best but tolerable i guess. The movie still had many great action packed scenes. Im still thinking if it was a good movie lol,3, 
"December 24, 2017","Great film. I'm a bit disappointed at how art focused it was instead of plot focused. I felt like Disney put too much of their own style to the film, when they should have kept more of what Star Wars originally was.",3, Nicole P
"December 24, 2017","I don't know why I keep doing this to myself. I keep saying they'll get better, it'll be alright, just give it a chance. Then as I sat through this film, constantly looking at my watch to see if it was over yet, I realized that there was no hope left in the galaxy. From the cliche one liners to the unbearable puns, which in my opinion ruined the movie, this film was mediocre at best. The characters had little development and terrible chemistry, the plot had mild build up despite the looming danger of the films hero's, politics (Actual, not the far far away kind and needn't I have to say more), out of place romance, I could go on and on. This totaled to be a two and a half hour film that ended with more questions than answers. When the film ended all I thought to myself was what did I just watch. It felt as though the people who were in charge of developing the new Star Wars series decided that there was no way they could continue to build on the story from episode XII, so they decided to tie up loose ends. On top of that this was just another cookie cutter Disney bundled film. Now I'm not going to give any spoilers, but if you've seen the movies Frozen or The Lion King, you'll recognize some of those plots in this film. My only hope is that George Lucas will get his hands really dirty in the coming Star Wars films because in the hands of Disney Star Wars will continue to take a nasty turn to the dark side. Reasons for why I went to this one in theaters over the other two is beyond me, but I will stick with Redbox for the next Star Wars films to come.",0.5, 
"December 24, 2017","As a die-hard Star Wars fan, it pains me terribly to write this review. But I have to do it, because it's true. Star Wars is dead. Disney and SJWs killed Star Wars. Star Wars was too good for this cruel world. Rest in peace, Star Wars.",0.5, Mark Z

"December 24, 2017","This movie was by far the worst Star Wars movie ever made. Forced Humor that wasn't funny, way too much effort on special effects and CGI. This movie is definitely just a cash crop. After the Force Awakens I had high hopes for this movie as I really enjoyed it. This movie was such a let down and makes me not want to see any future star wars movies from Disney.",0.5, 
"December 23, 2017","SW8 was very good, I'd even argue excellent. Multiple layers of mythos that conclude the story beyond my satisfaction. I get that Mark Hammil wasn't happy at all with this final rendition of Luke Skywalker. But this story ain't gospel folks- midlife is a bitch and Luke gave up. Happens sometimes. We are just lucky Luke decided to join the fight eventually.and do his part to buy time for Rey to save the day and help the residence survive. Everyone that's unhappy with this movie needs to finally grow up and realise that... STAR WARS HAS GROWN UP AND MOVED OUT OF THE HOUSE! New generation advances the story folks, and that's how life works. 1977-2017 is 40 years after all!",5, 
"December 23, 2017",Snoke is just dead. Code Breaker side quest was weird and a waste of a half hour. Slowest space chase in history? Hold back plans from Poe for what reason? Leia survives space.

Look at the AUDIENCE score, and tell me what is more accurate - the actual consumers of the business product or critics that have strong connections with PR/Marketing divisions of companies? Anyways, this movie, along with the suspect high acclaims, fake marketing, and the obvious politicizing of hard left wing ideologies ended my interest and love for the Star Wars franchise.",0, Joo Wan P

It's quite original and adds new magic to the force. Seriously: we have seen worse things in this saga. Like happy bears defeating the chosen troops of the empire, or the federation of squids sacrificing their commercial empire to pursue the goals of a hologram that looks like death. When Empire Strikes Back came out everyone was disappointed of it, because of introducing new things instead of making a copy of the previous one. I hope this film will also be re-evaluated.",5, Petar K
"December 23, 2017","While certainly not the best Star Wars movie (that title still holds on and will hold on to Empire), this eighth film in the franchise is by far the longest film in the series... and it feels that way. That's not to say it wasn't fun and there are some bad ass moments, but I suggest for Episode IX that they trim the fat. Whereas Force Awakens was essentially New Hope, The Last Jedi has some elements of Empire but not that much. There will be spoilers in this review, just a heads up.

I appreciate Luke actually speaking for a change, as opposed to the very end of FA, but seriously, he is one pissed owf dude. He's become the Bill Crotchety. Not even Obi Wan was this crotchety. Rey seeks to learn the force but Luke only wants to teach her how much of a failure it/he is. Meanwhile, the ship Leia is on is under attack by some dude with no soul and Kylo Mantha Beating Solo. I found the first attack scenes to be fun and brilliant, and then the movie slowwwwed down. Especially when Leia somehow survived that? Really? It picks up again when Laura Dern's Wig enters the scene and pisses owf everybody else. This isn't a movie where you want to cheer for the Rebel scum. They're a bunch of douches who forgot how to fight a war. That's one thing I noticed about this film, it is a lot darker than the other films int the franchise. I enjoyed the melding of Solo and Rey and thought that the fact that they could communicate via the force was interesting. I almost fell bad for Solo but then I remembered he killed Harrison Ford (or did Harrison Ford kill Solo?).

The culminating battle was neat but I felt it should have ended like Finn wanted to, or at least get rid of his sidekick. Make her do it. I also found parts of this film could definitely be riffed on, like Luke having fart power to lift off a rock. Oh yeah and some little stuboy knows the force too. Please don't get that kid from Jingul Ahl Duh Waye!

Overall it was a good entry in the series but I'm still conflicted how I feel about it. Maybe that's the point of the story. We're left to wonder which side we take. Should we take the dark side and expect the Leia-(and someone else)-less IX or should we celebrate the 9th entry with optimism and hope because Rey has a light saber at the end of this film. I dunno. I suspect that's what's polarizing audiences. The film feels long, disjointed, but then again it's Star Wars. That's just normal... right?",3, Justin W
"December 23, 2017","I feel like I just paid £5 to watch someone defecate on Luke Skywalker's face for over two hours.

It's visually beautiful, but I think they worked very hard indeed to alienate as many of their fanbase as was possible.

I came out of the film rating about about a 7/10, the more I think about it the more I dislike large parts of what they did. At best a 6/10. By tomorrow as I think about it more I think my rating will go even lower.

I bought my kids State Wars stuff, for Christmas. I am actually thinking of returning it, yes it really is that bad.",2, Alien W
"December 26, 2017",What a bunch of garbage. I can't believe Disney allowed this AWFUL director to completely ruin a Star Wars and then reward him by allowing him to write more episodes. It's almost like this idiot never even watched the last one and decided to make hie own Star Wars SJW movie. The Force Awakens was so good and this idiot decided to not even address any of the burning questions from the last one. This movie is a huge letdown and dissapintment. I never want to see anything Rian Johnson ever puts out again. Thanks for ruining Star Wars!,1, Jeremy M

"December 26, 2017","When George Lucas makes Star War movies, all he want is to tell his story, when Disney makes Star War movies, all they want is to get that $4 billion back and make more.

Disney doesn't have a story to tell, the whole movie is a mixture of subplots each serving a different marketing strategy. Nostalgia to sell tickets to fans, cute animals to sell toys, feminism to pander to the PC culture and meaningless jokes for schmucks.

The most disgraceful part is that Disney brings the old heroes back, only to make them old, fat, miserable and died in meanless ways. Disney has no story for them, they're just there to sell tickets.

This is not a Star Wars movie but a movie to attract Star Wars fans. Compare this movie to the originals is like comparing cola to wine, a look-alike and tastes very different.

"December 25, 2017",This was the last Stars Wars film I'll see in theaters. Critics got paid off on these reviews.,0, Mark D
"December 25, 2017","After reading all of the negative viewer complaints, I had determined that it might be better to wait and catch this movie on DVD or digital download. Curiosity got the better of me though, and when the opportunity arose, I headed out to the theatre to view The Last Jedi. However, I had read the plot synopsis and a hundred or so viewer reviews, both good and bad, so I went into the showing with no preconceptions or high expectations as to what this movie should or should not be.

I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. While The Last Jedi was no Empire Strikes Back, it certainly does not deserve to be ranked as low as the Prequel movies. I would say that it is at least as good as The Force Awakens, but is a bit more original than that movie. And while Rian Johnson did stretch the boundries of the Star Wars universe, I don't think he went so far as to break any basic laws of SW Physics. To those who give this movie low scores and say it is not a true Star Wars movie, i'll say that you are not true fans.

Now that the movie has been out for ten days, it would be pointless for me to put a review here that rehashes the plot. What I will do instead is give my take on some of the ""controversial"" points that have been brought up by other fans who lack any insight into what has happened in other installments of the franchise.

- Complaint: The humor was juvenille and off the mark.

- Somewhat Agree. Star Wars has always had a bit of humor to take the edge off of the seriousness - Leia cracking a joke about Vader's leash, Han's constant wisecracking, Vader making a choke pun or teasing about the Emperor's forgiveness, the implication that Obi-Wan might have a drinking problem. But any comic will tell you that timing is everything, and the OT and the PT seemed to have it down. While appreciated to break the bleak atmosphere of hopelessness in which The Last Jedi was set, the comedic timing was definitely off, and some of the jokes were over the top. We get it - life, even in times of war, is not 100% balls-to-the-wall seriousness. But The Last Jedi had just a bit more humor than what I think should be there.

- Complaint: Poe Dameron was a complete dick.

- Strongly Agree. For me, it started downhill with the Poe character about 90 seconds into the movie, when he ""tooled"" General Hux by making a ""your mother"" joke while attacking a First Order Dreadnaught (again bad comedic timing). And honestly, by five minutes into the movie, he should have been in the brig for the rest of the movie, as his actions caused a lot of deaths and destruction among Resistance Forces. Oh, and there is also that business about insubordination and outright mutiny. But, by the end of the movie, Leia pretty much handed Poe leadership of the Rebellion, which is a necessity since everyone else is dead, and of course we know that Leia will either will have to be implied offscreen or written out before Episode IX. In light of these events, I hope that J.J. will write in some ""growing up"" into Poe for the next movie.

- Complaint: Tracking ships through Hyperspace is old news.

- Agree. Apparently, Rian Johnson did not research this plot point. The earliest ship tracking in the SW-verse happens in Attack of the Clones when Obi-Wan Kenobi put a tracking device on Jango Fetts ship and follwed him to a Separatist hideout. Darth Vader tracked the Falcon to Yavin 4 - it was Leia, who seemed incredulous about in this movie, who told Han about all those years ago.

As an asides, why would you need Hyperspace tracking? Your ship transponder beacon would be like a cell phone signal anyway, and as soon as it hit on a satellite or ship anywhere in the galaxy you could just jump to that location and harass them some more.

- Complaint: Snoke was a waste of a character and his end was far to swift.

- Disagree. While I would love to see a little more backstory, the movie was quite effective in establishing his badassedness, and the fact that he was arrogant to the point of distraction, which ultimately was his undoing. BUT, I do not think this will be the last we see of ""Snoke"". Let me throw a little more fuel on the fire that Snoke was reincarnation of previous Sith Lords by saying I loved the fact that while Snoke was torturing Rey, the Emperor's Theme song was crescendoing in the background. Nice touch.

- Complaint: Luke would never have went to kill Ben Solo after sensing the dark side in the boy.

- Disagree. Your father was Darth Vader, and Emperor Palpatine may as well have been your Creepy Uncle. Together they killed your mother, destroyed the Jedi, and fried your poor auntie and uncle who raised you, not to mention all the other bad shit they did around the galaxy. Just exactly how would you react to sense those exact same capabilities in your student? Would you just take away his lightsaber, kick him out of the Academy, and tell him to be a good boy? In my opinion, Luke's failure was NOT killing Ren then and there.

- Complaint: Leia's Superman moment was ""Marvelish"" and out of character.

- Disagree. I thought this moment was well done and did not at all look out of place or ""take me out of the movie"". Leia was strong with the Force. The Force connects and binds things, as we are told. Being blown into space is not an immediate death, and for someone strong with the Force, it would not at all be a stretch to pull themselves back to the ship. Now in open space with nowhere to go, it would be a different story, and if they ever decide to have Jedi flying from planet to planet using the Force alone, that would be definite overkill.

- Complaint: Jedi connections, between Rey and Kylo, over vast distances should not happen.

- Disagree. This has totally happened before in Star Wars cannon. The Emperor sensed that Vader was in trouble on Mustafar and set out to rescue him. Ben sensed the explosion of Alderaan. In a ROTJ cut scene, Vader tried to entice Luke, who was on Tattooine, while Vader was near Endor. And it has been implied that Yoda and Ben Kenobi could communicate from Tattooine to Dagogah, but did so very seldom for fear that The Emperor could sense it.

- Complaint: Yoda showing up ""in the flesh"" could not happen.

- Disagree. In the recent book that has tales from different characters around the time of a New Hope, Qui-Gon Jinn appears to Ben Kenobi. Kenobi remarks at how ""real"" Qui-Gon is, to which he tells Ben that he can be as real as he is needed to be. Apparently, Jedi who have studied the Living Force can not only become concious Force entities, but they can also cross back over in to the temporal realm if need be. It does bring hope that we might see Luke again, and maybe even old Obi-Wan could make an appearance.

BTW, I thought the Yoda puppet was very well done, much more faithful to the original than the abomination that was used in The Phantom Menace.

- Complaint: The Rose/Finn/DJ story arc was wasted time and an unnecessary contribution to the movie.

- Agree: After making Finn a hero, you paint him as a deserter, team him with a disposable sidekick, make an unnecessary trip to Las Vegas, and then team them up with another useless character, simply to get Finn back into a position to fight Phasma. This entire story arc made the movie drag in the middle, and in the end, accomplished NOTHING - Laura Dern's Vice Admiral Holdo ended up doing the job for them.

I'll also add here that Phasma should not have been brought back for such a small role. I understand that she is the NT's equivalent of Boba Fett, but she really did nothing to enhance the story, other than to become one of the most unlucky - or inept - characters in the entire Star Wars universe.

- Complaint: Luke Skywalker's character was completely disrespected.

- Strongly Disagree. One of my favorite movies from yesteryear was ""The Sting"". Paul Newman played a washed up con-man who is recruited to take down a big time Mafioso for revenge. When approached about the job, even though he was once the best at the art of the Con, he refuses to go along with the plan, preferring the bottle and cheap grifts and telling his future protege that he's got the wrong man.

I loved Rian Johnsons take on Luke Skywalker. This Luke wasn't the wide-eyed farm boy, or the fully-realized Jedi standing proud before the Emperor. This Luke was one that had seen and done it all. This Luke realized too late that even though he was a Jedi Master, that did not make him a good Jedi Teacher. This Luke, scarred by his failure, basically told his protege ""you've got the wrong guy"". And add to that, he knew the history of the Jedi, about how they failed because of their own arrogance, and because of it he believed that the galaxy was better off without them.

I don't exactly agree with Luke's passing. I think that the conflict should have been in the flesh, with a Kenobi-like result. But, it was a powerful, full circle ending for the old Master. Unlike Han's death, which was put in to accomodate the actor's desires, I wont watch the OT movies now and have instant regret when I see Luke in them because I know that his future end will be in keeping with the values of the Jedi Knights.

What else worked for me in this movie:

- The scene in which Snoke chides Kylo Ren as a ""boy in a mask"" and gives him a shocking lesson in the power of the Dark Side.

- Artoo conversing with Luke, and his ""cheap trick"" to try to convince Luke to join the Resistance.

- The entire confrontation between Snoke, Rey, and Ren.

- The moment Kylo Ren gave his final entreaty to Rey to join him. In that moment, when he said to let all of the old things die, I myself was almost convinced that the First Order should win the war.

- The score. It was very familiar. There were snippets from The Force Awakens. From A New Hope, the ""Tie Fighter Attack"". From Return of the Jedi, ""The Emperors Theme"". There were even snippets of music from some of the Prequels dribbled in here and there.

What did not work:

- The movie was overly long, and dragged in the middle. I do beleive that the Canto Bight sequence was nothing more than eye candy, and it could have been dropped with no ill effects. It was simply a setup to place Finn aboard the Supremacy so he could fight Phasma. 

As I said in the beginning, this movie deserves better than most of the negative press that it is getting. It is well worth going to see at least once, maybe twice to take in all the stuff you didnt get the first time around. I would rank it at a tie with the Force Awakens at #4, just below Revenge of the Sith, but just above Return of the Jedi.",3,

"December 25, 2017","Even JarJar Binks would be ashamed of this train wreck. 

As a along time fan of the franchise, I am disappointed to see the turn the series has taken. This movie destroys any good qualities to be found in a Star Wars movies. It is saturated with mundane, forcibly ""quirky"" characters, quips which ruin every emotional event, universe inconsistencies that would have seriously altered the plot of the movie if taken into account, and needless pandering to the audience. Some might say these criticisms are ill founded and too harsh, but theyre not.

"December 25, 2017",Worst star wars since the prequels. This was not a movie. It was a catastrophe. It was basically a collection of action scenes all stringed together with no purpose. Rays family origins make her seem completely uninteresting. Finn and Rose provide zero new value to the film and there mission was a complete failure consuming 30 minutes of the film. There romance was also an utter waste and not worth of our attention. Snokes background was also similarly ignored in an almost similar fashion of Ray. Snoke brags of his telepathic ability yet he can't predict Kylo rens betrayal. Lukes character closely resembled a suicidal skid row alcoholic. A complete contrast of the jedi order.

"December 25, 2017","This movie was good but fell short of the last in my opinion. I don't believe that it deserves all of the hate that I am reading on other reviews. This is spoiler filled but I am sure you already know that. 

My biggest issue with the movie was Fin's story line. It fell short because I don't believe it mattered in the end. They just ended up failing and as for Rose I didn't really find myself liking her character. 

This movie does what the prequels did when considering the view of the Jedi. It expanded upon the lore and mythos of the world of Star Wars and what the Force actually means. I am not arguing the prequel movies were good but I am saying that you cannot evolve a franchise without change and expansion of the material that you already have. Rian Johnson decided to take the Force in a whole new direction and expand upon what it means to the person capable of using it and what it means to the world (or Galaxy) in general. The force is not just something that you can move shit with...it is an energy that shapes the world around the mythos of this universe and guides its characters. Choosing new and innovative ways to explore that power is just what this franchise needed. The audience will not be pleased and by other reviews that are on this site you will see that there is absolutely no pleasing everyone. Further than that it is getting more hate for giving that audience exactly what it wanted a change. The force awakens was apparently too similar to A New Hope. And this movie is ""bad"" because it is too different. You can't ask for something then be upset when you are given what you wanted in the first place. 

Let's look at the problems that most people have with this movie:

The star cruiser going light speed into the enemy star destroyer. The main criticism that I have see is why haven't they just done this before. Well why would you waste a perfectly good star cruiser blasting it into the enemy. The rebels never had the funds to just throw large crafts at the enemy. If you think ""well what don't they just make ships for that purpose?"" That wouldn't make a really good story would it; ""Let's just throw ships at each other and call it a story, yay!"".

The use of the force in ways that we have never seen. Well for this one we have always known that the force is the energy that binds things together. In past movies we have seen Jedi masters disappear and reappear as spirits, so why is it so far off that a Jedi master could project an image of himself worlds away? Especially one as strong as Luke must have become. 

Luke's change of personality that lead to the creation of Kylo Ren. There is always (or I guess I should say there should always be) an equal amount of light and dark in the universe. The Jedi are not immune from the temptations of the dark side and this is proven by the fall of Anakin and Count Dooku and many other Sith lords. Is it so far out of the realm of possibility that the Dark is always present and can be calling to even Jedi masters? Personally I think not. And in addition to this Luke's voluntary exile was because he failed himself and Ben. This was penance for his almost crime and the push the cause Ben to become Kylo. 

This movie went in directions that I could not predict. This has been unlike any Star Wars movie I have seen. I want to know other things that people were upset with because I know you are overreacting and nitpicking WAY too much.",3, Will K

"December 25, 2017","Really not a good movie. If you got rid of the Star Wars legacy and judged it strictly as a stand-alone storytelling it would have been a direct-to-video candidate.

It (like a lot of the Star Wars movies and culture) seems to be designed for the intellect and sensibilities of children. I do not dislike this movie because of how it treated the Star Wars legacy or anything like that. I'm neither a Star Wars hater or fanboy. It just wasn't a very good movie.

"December 25, 2017","As a movie, it's ok. The overall sound seems decent, though it can be hard to hear some dialogue, which is critical for the new spin on things. As a Star Wars movie I hate it. Guardians of the Galaxy is a good movie, taking a long standing universe like Star Wars and treating it to GotG style comedy and expecting it to fly is bad form. Star Wars has always had humor, but this isn't the same school of it.

Then let's throw away everything we know about some of of longest running characters in Star Wars. The universe and all its history be damned, these characters can do whatever the hell they want. It isn't a terrible story, but it isn't in line with everything we've seen so far. I couldn't enjoy the movie as I was constantly trying to reconcile what I was seeing with all I already know about Star Wars.",1, Gregory S
"December 25, 2017","Regardless of anything ""star wars"" within this movie, it's terribly written. Extremely poor plot with a ridiculous amount of plot holes and terrible pacing. 2 hours of the movie were structured around a capital ship chase scene - a ridiculous concept that destroyed any suspension of disbelief. Why didn't the First Order call for more ships, or send some star destroyers ahead of the way (through hyperspace) to box in the resistance? They had apparently 6-18 hours to work with. When else has fuel been a problem within the rest of the films? Why play in a casino and worry about animal abuse when you've got the entire resistance depending on you? Who is Snoke? And why does he only have melee body guards? Does nobody think a gun might be useful to have in his throne room? Nothing about this film was believable, every aspect was poorly written. Disney has also added too much humor in an attempt to please all ages, but it's awkwardly written and terribly out of place. As a second entry in a trilogy, and 8th in a saga, it spits in the face of the established universe that other directors & writers have created. A major issue deals with hyperspace being utilized as a weapon - something we've never seen before in any Star Wars. If that's possible, why didn't rebels do that on the Death Star, or any number of other space battles? How did the first order become so powerful, if the empire was defeated in episode 6 and supposedly there was a good republic around for 30 years? Where did they come from? Why is the resistance so small? Now, it'd be fine to be ""subversive"" in a spin-off movie and make all the points the director wanted to (e.g, arms-dealers are bad and the galaxy is systemically broken), but not episode 8 of a 9 episode series. Finally there's the issue of Luke acting far outside of his character. It's completely ridiculous. I am incredibly disappointed in the direction Rian Johnson went here, and am very worried that he's now working on his own Star Wars trilogy. I didn't think Star Wars could get any worse than The Phantom Menace, boy was I wrong.",0, Private U
"December 25, 2017","Despite throwing away all the build up and history, and being disrespectful with legendary characters, the movie didn't need to be so dumb, it tried to hard to be funny and cool looking, but didnt care about the history, writing, characters and overall state of the Star Wars universe.

"December 25, 2017","I never thought I'd say this, but PLEASE give me the Phantom Menace again, as bad as the prequels were they never made me extremely mad. There's so much wrong with Last Jedi that it's crazy, SO MUCH!! If you liked this movie then you're a total moron, only a diehard fanboy or a Disney shill could like this. It's complete & utter dogcrap. The reviews here at least prove that when it comes to Disney we can't trust a single word from critics, they're just complete shills. 

There's so much wrong with this movie, all the nonsense new force powers that would have been really useful 6 movies ago. Leia flying, I think Sidious could really have used that ability in Return of the Jedi, total garbage. 

Using light speed to get through a planets shields like they did in Force Awakens, they could have really used that in Return of the Jedi, they wouldn't have to waist half the movie running around with Ewoks. 

Then using Light Speed as a weapon?!?! That REALLY could have been useful 6 movies ago, that could have been used to take down the Death Star, this is just horrendous writing, with absolutely NO CARE about canon. 

Rey is a COMPLETE Mary Sue, anyone who says different is a complete & utter moron, she picks up a lightsaber for the first time & defeats a Skywalker (Kylo), who's trained since childhood as a Jedi, it's ridiculous. It took Luke 3 movies to gain the power to beat Vader, in Empire Vader beats him & cuts off his hand even after months of training with Yoda. 

Why on earth should the Rebels be afraid of the First Order now? There's no reason, Rey has already beat Kylo, so where's the conflict? 

Luke could see the good in Vader, the second most evil person in the galaxy, someone who killed his mentor, someone responsible for the deaths of billions, but was going to kill Kylo because he was going a little off course?!? 

And Snoke, the big bad guy built up to look badass, the only interesting new character at all, they just killed him in a ridiculous way in the second movie?!?! All the hours I spent looking at stuff about his origins & now they kill him without ANYTHING!! The writers are pure dogcrap, they haven't got a clue how to write a good character. It's so bad that it's driving me nuts. 

And now they've killed absolutely EVERY interesting character, there's no one left that's in any way interesting. I'm finished with Star Wars, I won't even watch the third movie, I'll watch the continuation to Rogue One, as that movie was great. 

Then all the SJW bullcrap, animal cruelty & the usual SJW propaganda, it's insane that Disney are incapable of making a movie without pushing their postmodern bullcrap. I hate them with every fibre in my body. 

Reys backstory, so now anyone can be as powerful as Skywalkers, even though we've spent 6 movies saying that Skywalkers are the MOST powerful Jedi in the Universe, no Jedi will EVER be so powerful. But here we have Mary Sue, a nobody, Queen feminist powerhouse. Total bullcrap. 

There's so much more wrong with this movie but it'll take me all day to type it out, SO MUCH WRONG!! It's so horrendous that it's insane, in order to like this you have to be a crazy person or just a complete fanboy who sucks off Star Wars all day, who can't hear anything negative about Star Wars whatsoever. 

The movie is beyond terrible, I hate Disney & I hate all the critics who've given it a score above 90%, that truly shows you how corrupt these critics are, I wouldn't be surprised if they're all on the Disney payroll, I can't see any other reason for that score, they're nothing but shills.

Why make Luke a broken, defeated guy who is bearly affected by learning his best friend was murdered? Why then kill him off in such a blase fashion? Mind you, the astral projection of Luke was a great idea, it was just done terribly. Why kill him that way?

Captain Phazma, a character overall liked was just killed off and when he did die, you were pushed to have emotions for a one-dimensional character.

If JJ Abrams can save this smoking pile of rubbish then he will have absolutely earned my respect as a writer and film director because he has his work cut out for him. This movie was bad, bad, bad!

"December 24, 2017","This movie was disappointing. Luke Skywalker, who was supposed to be the most powerful Jedi ever is just a ""grumpy old master who gave up"". The Last Jedi wasted the opportunity to make all Star Wars fans witness the true powers of the force from its master. Killing off Luke just wasted the opportunity and killed the actual Skywalker bloodline. Luke Skywalker, who lost his mother at birth and never knew her, saw his uncle and aunt burn, lost his arm, and lost his father just after redemption never got a happy ending or a family. He instead died because of ""space FaceTime"". Rey is just the daughter of two junkies but somehow is strong with the force WITHOUT training. Even Anakin wasn't that instantly strong. And the whole casino scene didn't make any since nor did it contribute to the story. Kylo Ren, who was supposed to become more powerful in the dark side after killing his father and MAGICALLY losing to ""nobody"" Rey is just the same old emo. Snoke who was so strong is somehow just a nobody. But most importantly, we didn't even get a lightsaber duel...",0.5, Abdallah E

"December 24, 2017","Where does one begin with this train wreck?. lets start with Rey's ability to get yet more Jedi skills with no training - millennials showing their entitled work ethic? Then Johnson used Back To The Future's flux capacitor for hyperspace tracking. He killed off Snoke giving us absolutely no background behind the man who assembled empire 2.0. Johnson introduced new characters like a stream of consciousness poem by Virginia Wolff. johnson killed off luke skywalker to mask his crappy plot, and destroyed 40 years of Star Wars story plot. Finn was portrayed as a bumbling idiot in his zip lock bag; whereas every other character gets a bacta tank. The kid at the end of the movie reminded me of something recycled from a walt disney storybook cartoon prelude. Episode 7 &8 are basically sci fiction's equivalent of Bill Murray's ground hog day: empire 2.0, darth vader lite, ape walkers, etc... crystal foxes? yeah, i guess they wouldn't burn everything from sun magnification through their crystal fur.... And who cares about that chrome bumper stormtrooper? when johnson killed off captain plasma with a death worthy of Die Hard - absolutely no audience member cheered or gave a crap! why? because captain phantasic had no character development... why was she evil? i guess her bad fashion armor..... Space bombers? What about the space ship chase where 2 ships burns fuel in space, where inertia shouldn't require more fuel. Then, why didn't 1/2 the first order fleet hyperspace ahead of the rebel fleet, to stop the rebel fleet? What purpose did the Benito Del Toro character have? None.

Really, the biggest issue is a crappy plot, with really lame filler material to distract us. Like Luke milking a sea cow. The entire movie used a bunch of garbage, for the sole purpose of setting up Rey vs Ren in a love/hate teenage relationship. What is the point? Can't you watch re-runs of Dawson's creek or Beverly Hills 90210 for the same plot?",0.5, scott g
"December 24, 2017","I had some hope for this movie originally. My partner hated Kylo Ren, I liked the concept of his character being explored and developed. And, to this movie's credit, it explored Kylo's character and turned my partner's opinion of him to a positive as well. Besides this, the only thing I can say this movie did well was in its portrayal of Supreme Leader Snoke, who commands any scenes he's in.

However, almost everywhere else, the movie falls flat. While my hopes for Kylo Ren were matched, my biggest hope for this movie (seeing Luke Skywalker display the full power of the force) was utterly quashed. Asides from one technique employed, while impressive, Leia uses the force in more overt and potent ways (including pushing open a star ship door). This from the character which took down an AT-AT with nothing but a lightsaber, a grappling cable, and a thermal detonator at the age of 21. Ultimately, what should be the biggest draw to this movie for fans of the original trilogy falls flat and leaves a sour taste in a fan's mouth.

Much of the plot and characters don't make sense. Rey becomes a full Mary Sue, displaying potency with the force that far surpasses Luke's display after two years of training with just a month, at most, of active use of the Force. Keep in mind, Luke is literally the son of the Jedi Jesus, and realistically, has probably the highest potential with the force short of another 'Chosen One', which if they made Rey one would be the ultimate spitting on the series and everything that Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader were. The admiral which takes command of the resistance and must lead it through a difficult, morale devastating situation refuses to share the plan for how she's going to lead them to safety - even when a captain/commander and respected hero of the fight privately asks her - instead she takes the time to dress him down for being a glory hound (with the only evidence that he's cocky, and willing to risk his life for the Resistance). Fin gets a side kick character that has no personality, takes up screen time, moralizes to the viewer, and ultimately serves to prevent Fin from reaching a natural and emotional conclusion to his character arc (and in the process, likely doom the Resistance).

All of this hinges on the fact that the New Republic managed to exist for 30 years with TOTAL military disarmament, with pretty much all of their fleet stationed ON PLANET (and not on patrol, like actual military craft frequently are), while a hostile, expansionist, military threat exists on their border, allowing the First Order to pretty much conquer the galaxy in at most a month from the last movie. The First Order didn't even need Starkiller Base, they could have just walked over and killed the Republic with just having SHIPS.

Oh yes, and apparently Chewbaca is a vegetarian now. Guess the writer's didn't think a race that only had sharp fangs might be carnivorous and would die without protein.

If you're not a heavy fan of the old Star Wars series, its possible to enjoy this movie as it does try to emulate the theme and pacing of other blockbusters like Guardians of the Galaxy and the Avengers, but fails to actually feel like a Star Wars space opera for most of the movie. But most old fans will be left radiating anger in the theater as the movie destroys their childhood franchise and the characters they came to bond with on screen. The last movie might have killed Han, but his character was still, mostly, in tact. This one completely destroyed the characters that people loved.

PS: Yes, that was THE Admiral Ackbar that dies at the start of the movie too. At this point I'm just thankful they didn't include a reference with him shouting its a trap shortly before he died. Also it was eye rolling when they included the fat 'Porkins' x-wing pilot dying in Rogue One, two movies in a row is groan worthy.",0.5,

Admittedly, when I got out of the movie, I thought that the very last part had salvaged some of the major flaws of the storyline and had provided a somewhat satisfying experience. But then, too much of bad storytelling had happened...

- Leia as Mary Poppins - come on! This was likely the worst scene EVER in the Star Wars franchise

- The forced and unnecessary Finn/ Rose interaction/ distraction. This was so boring, did not move the plot forward and was in the end simply annoying. The Finn character took damage here

- Luke's role is perhaps not as bad as I have seen some reviewers made it to be, but it is also very unsatisfying and results in the dismantling of a Star Wars fixture

- The casino planet scenes served no purpose. The whole part was ridiculous

- I would rate it the third worst movie in the Star Wars franchise (sorry, still can't get over JJB)",1, Axel G

"December 24, 2017","Cinematically, the picture is simply stunning. Both in the island setting as well as the space battles. The Rey and Kylo fighting Snokes Elite Praetorian Guards was something you don't want to blink through as it's quite the epic fight scene. Other than those points, Episode 8 was a major let down to even the average Star Wars fan. So many plot holes and so many unanswered questions from Episode 7 that are either never answered or completely glossed over as though Episode 7 meant nothing to this movie, the next chapter in the saga. It actually felt as though this movie had absolutely nothing to do with the previous one, AT ALL. Like they took the script from Episode 7 and Rian Johnson just tossed it in the trash can and started an entirely new movie.

The biggest disappointment is what they did with Luke. Luke fricken Skywalker...the most powerful Jedi next to Yoda. We never see him wield his emerald lightsaber, (something fans were longing for), we never get to see him in a lightsaber battle with Kylo or the Knights of Ren. There's a small moment towards the end where you think to yourself,. ""Oooh boy! Luke is gonna kick some butt now!! Here we go! It's gonna go down now!"".....NOPE. 

It was one failed moment after another. We get to find out who Rey's parents are? NOPE. We get to find out more about Snoke? NOPE. A subplot story gets created that will elevate the film? NOPE.

If it turns out that Episode 9 reveals the heavy questions that were seriously hinted at in Episode 7, I'll come back and change this review. But for now, this movie is a complete let down to the Star Wars saga.

One last thing, Laura Dern's character (Admiral Holdo)...was a waste of a character. If she had simply told Poe her plan to escape to the planet they were slowly moving towards....the subplot where Finn and Rose go the planet Las Vegas would have NEVER happened. Seriously, why NOT tell Poe the plan?! He's a high ranking officer and your best pilot, you know his loyalty is to the rebellion! Why wouldn't you tell him?! Oh yea, then you wouldn't have this Las Vegas planet subplot for Finn and Rose.

It was just a poorly written and directed movie. It's like they haven/t laid out the outline and storyboards for all three movies yet. Which I hope to God isn't the case.",1, Carlos S

"December 24, 2017","This is a low IQ, overly snarky, Star Wars. At movie number 11 in the official canon this needs to build on the established dogma of the Jedi and Luke - after all it is called the Last Jedi and Luke is a main character in it, but this one has its own false ideas about what Jedi are and who Luke really is at the core. With our Star Wars IQ having been raised with Revenge of the Sith, and The Clone Wars, and Rebels and the offficial intelligent canon novels like Tarken and Catalyst, we have had our expectations and our Star Wars IQ raised. And after 30 years we finally get to find out what Luke did after ROTJ, while disregarding some pretty good expanded universe novels that cover this since they are not canon anymore after. But instead of having something good to turn to we get this aberration of a Star Wars story told by someone who seems to have no real knowledge - or most likely probably doesn't care to - of Jedi and Luke and Leia and anything else with Star Wars on a real intelligent level. And I can only assume that Disney does care about these things, not just making money, but the oversight and quality control was spread thin doing 3 movies at the same time, (Rogue One, Last Jedi, Han Solo movie) and since they spent a lot of time micromanaging RO and Han Solo, that they just left this one alone in the uncaring hands of Riam Johnson and the ironically enough he put out the worst Star Wars movie by far of any of them going back to 1977. I am still in a state of shock over this and then to read quotes from Johnson himself saying, ""loosen up Star Wars should be fun."" I am speechless. This movie is horrible and unfaithful to all things Star Wars and he says that. Even Mark Hamill himself disowns this version of Luke!? That is true. I want to forget this movie even exists and I hope this movie fails enough that Disney does some real soul searching about episode 9 and how much they want to be known as the turning point when Star Wars turned bad after Lucas got out. Listen to your fans Disney! Listen to the people who know this world better than Rian Johnson! This story is incongruent with all established things about Luke and the Jedi and all established things in this world. But even if you take away Luke and that whole part of it. This story is just bad! The side characters, the way things unfold, the dialogue, the sci-fi physics, the plausability of how things happened in this. It is an insult to me. I feel like I want to insult Riam Johson and the main people who told this story and wrote this dialogue for insulting my intelligence. A Star Wars movie where the established good guy is not really good anymore, just wants to die, and give up, is unfathomable. Where dialogue sounds like Archie Bunker wrote it. I have to think this is a Star Wars movie for those with a low IQ, overly snarky, and dauche bag ideas of right and wrong. On the few plus sides, Adam Driver was great in his role and acting and so was Daisy Ridley. The artistry of this film is extraordinary. However Luke and his story is long awaited point of it. And that is where it fails to a huge degree. Also with the side stories and side characters. There was just too much and too many. The whole backstory of Luke and Ben and the new Jedi Order is a whole movie and series of stories onto itself but all we get is a few minutes of the unplausable idea that was presented.

All the previous Lucas movies turned him into a Jedi badd@ss and he just becomes irrelevant like a fart in the wind in his last scene. They are trying to insert too much cuteness humor for a lack of humorous dialogue and to sell toys. Stupid bird things. The plot was just a stitching together of far fetched ideas beyond the normal sci fiction genre. The movie never had that epic feel but an over budgeted cheesy movie on the sci fi channel. This is just above the Phantom Menace triliogies. You now have two bigger jedi bad@sses than Luke. One of which never had any training and the little she got was 3 days hard to get by Luke.

"December 24, 2017","Bad movie, bad star wars movie... this movie grabbed the idiot ball and held on. Sorry this is going to be hate filled.

Ok so now we are confirmed that the Republic fell like a rotting house when the door was kicked in.

The Poe and Hux dialogue while funny doesn't belong in the movie unless your creating a Saturday morning cartoon. Also do dreadnoughts not have shields, and why would you have bombers that physically need to drop something... in Space!!! Why not torpedo bombers like Y-Wings or B-Wings. Also why are the rest of the Star Destroyers just sitting their jacking off. Seriously that was the most anti-climatic space battle ever. Seriously I cannot get over how stupid the bombers were, seriously who would ever design something like that for SPACE combat.

Moving from the opening stupidity we know the First Order is weeks away from conquering every important system in the galaxy, but was afraid of a Fleet orbiting what... 5 systems? How big is the Order supposed to be to be worried about that and yet be able to steam roll the galaxy? Seriously does no-one have a planetary defense force, was the whole of the Republic fleet sitting above those Five-ish Planets. How the hell would you even police a galaxy let alone defend it with so small a force. Hell one of the reasons the Separatist crisis emerged was because the Old Republic could't police the old Republic and enforce its laws. In the OT it made sense to see small concentrations of ships. The Rebellion was a tiny group fighting against a massive empire holding down the galaxy. As for the Empire, one they were holding down the galaxy and ,two, its a big place the rebellion could be anywhere. The only time we needed to see fleets was at Endor where the Rebels brought their entire fleet, which was still relatively small, and the Imperial Fleet, again relatively small, present was one that could be moved without anyone noticing.

Ok, for the flight from the Resistance base... really they're running out of gas? I realize I let my car run until the light comes on before I refuel it, but that's a really bad idea for a military or quasi military organization. Or are they suggesting they had no fuel reserves because that's like a big thing. I mean this movie takes place moments have Force Awakens so its not like the burnt it up fighting and they couldn't have used it up fleeing. Hell we've seen ships fly across the galaxy without refueling, Vader's fleet crusided around the Rim without a replenishment ship... unless the Executor carried fuel for her little sisters, but that's never come up before. So apparently they were sitting around on ""E"" because they're... dumb.

Do they still use Hypermatter as fuel btw because doesn't that shit last like forever?

So them running from the First Order fleet this started off good... apart from the forgetting to fuel the ships... the attack when it first emerged was cool, though again the Star Destroyers sitting around and jacking off was dumb. The fighter combat was cool though why couldn't we have had another, maybe good, space battle? Snoke's ship was interesting but from everything we've heard its a factory ship not a combat ship. Though I'll give them props for at least giving it a sizable escort. Also don't Star Destroyer have like a hundred guns, why do we only ever see like one or two shots?

When they blew up the bridge I was super impressed... that would have been a good death for Princess Leia and really you could have given the rest of her lines to the Vice Admiral whoever, but then they blew it. I mean really, Leia can survive being spaced... we've never had any indication that she's had force raising let alone enough to SURVIVE IN THE VACUUM OF SPACE and then pull herself back into the ship however minutes later. Also now we know you have shields while the hell weren't they on before the fighters came... seriously do shields only matter when its relevant to the plot?

Also Ackbar died... I did realize it was even him until Poe said something... kinda a demotion there admiral went from the Admiral of the entire rebel fleet to... six ships?

Casino planet is... meh though it does bring up a rather stupid plot hole. So the rich people are arms dealers or mostly arms dealers so apparently they're are no rich shipping magnates, actors, sports players, whatever, but OK I assume she was generalizing. Selling guns, however, to a war machine capable of overrunning the galaxy in weeks... really? I mean if would understandable if this was a small terrorist like group, but a war machine of this size? Even if she was talking about the Arms Industry I still don't buy it. I mean if that's the case a galaxy-conquering war machine was built without anyone knowing it and how they hell did the First Order pay for it? No one got sucpsions when someone was doing R&D for new Star Destroyers or TIE fighters? Seriously they couldn't have gone with secret shipyards in the Unknown Regions built by the Empire prior to its fall?

The fall of the Jedi Temple... I kinda like the idea of Luke being so afraid of releasing another Darth Vader that he'd consider drastic actions only to decide against it and for Ren to misunderstand. Its kinda of a cliche, but hey its a reason why he's so broken. But again really, Kylo Ren thought he killed Luke... shouldn't there have been a massive galaxy shaking disturbance if Luke Skywalker, Jedi Grand Master died. Did he not check physically or use the Force to check that's seems lazy, especially if you believe the guy wants to kill you. Also where did he meet Snoke? He's not a guy that can really blend in.

Luke's ""let the Jedi End"" was weak. I mean really as long as they're are Sith or other Dark Side equivalents they're has to be someone to fight. Luke's entire attitude struck me as moral cowardice. I realize he was a broken man, but still saying 'let the galaxy burn' is bad. The only way to really win and end the Dark-light squabble is to take Kreia's route and murder the Force itself... though the consequences might be... dire. Also the Force now is trippy and Yoda came back to tell Luke Rey is awesome, not when he ran away, not when he abandoned the Galaxy to the Dark Side, not to suck it up and go fight the good fight, but to tell Luke how awesome Rey is. Whatever happen to show don't tell.

Now to the female Vice-Admiral who apparently decided to wear formal wear while a member of the Resistance and a Second Galactic Civil War is starting. Did you not have time to change and look professional? Were you at all ball or cocktail party... or with dinosaurs? How many Admirals are in this six-ish ship fleet anyway? Also the disrespect she gives Poe, who at this point is most likely the senior pilot officer and the defacto Wing Commander, is astounding. Yes he disobeyed orders, but seriously praise in public, criticize in private... where the hell did she get her admiral's bars? We later learn this was because they (writers) were setting up the big reveal of a planet that's apparently not on any maps and apparently their sensors can't detect? Even then all she would of had to do is tell Poe, one of her most senior officers, this and it would have ended the issue. Instead she tells him to have hope... hope is not a plan lady, hope is wishful thinking. Hell she could have said ""trust me there is a plan"" instead of giving off the vibe that they're was none but no have hope because hope is more powerful then star destroyers.

Rehash of RotJ throne room scene.

God that was cringy... like bad fan fiction levels levels of cringy. Most of the Rey/Kylo stuff is OK and even good but Snoke is just... the Emperor but not the Emperor. Also creating a Force bond across lightyears... and fucking with Ren's emotions to deceive Rey, ok, but then how can you then not realize that Ren is going to betray you. Hell you can only kick the dog so often and to make it worse couldn't it have been more telegraphed for the audience. The fight with the Red, totally not Imperial, Guard was ok, but I think both Rey and Rentend to forget they have Force powers well they'd really be useful. To give them credit I was ecstatic that Kylo Ren wasn't redeemed, that would have been too much. Kinda disappointed Rey didn't join him, not that I expected her too. Also side note I kinda want them to screw now, is that weird. I think they have odd but good chemistry.

Also Snoke is dead... all that build up, all that mystery for what totally not surprising surprise and funny face joke?

The destruction of the Supremacy was a cool shot, but kinda dumb. I mean if its that easily why not rig up remote control ships and just jump them into others. You created another plot hole that didn't a have to be there. Also I don't think that's how hyperspace works. You are in a different ""dimension"" or something... I mean you have to watch out for planets and other celestial bodies because they cast mass shadows. Also the MonCal ship waited a long time before turning while her shuttles got shot up. I thought she was going to turn and engage which would have been cool-ish and a little more dramatic... also Phasma died... ok why did we need her back?

The crystal planet... seriously guys that was a fucking horrible plan if they even had one. I mean there are what like 100ish members left and they threw away how many? Also what the hell were they flying... salt surfing skimmers that can kinda maybe fly when needed. If they can fly why didn't a few fly up to fight the TIEs? Christ that was stupid and also why did the Asian lady stop Fynn from where I was sitting it probably would have worked and prevented the breach... wasn't that the point? What did all the redshirts die for then? If I want to watch the Battle of Hoth I can watch Empire

Astral/Force projection over lightyears? I mean it is Luke Skywalker and he is on a Force nexus so... Ok. The fight was Ok too though I wonder what made Kylo Ren think he could take Luke Skywalker. You can't beat the lady who STILL hasn't had a minute of actual light-saber or a real Force training session and you think you can beat the guy who beat Darth Vader? I mean this is Luke fucking Skywalker

Luke's death was meh. I mean he allowed the Resistance to escape so... yeah, but come on that's how he dies, a heart attack or something from strain?

So at the end of the movie... where back at episode III ending. Evil Empire controls the galaxy, how I have no idea, and new plucky band of rebels is forming to fight the First Order. God, people is this what we waited for... a worse ripoff of the OT, at least the prequels did something new, they expanded the universe and told an original story. Worse even this invalidates everything the original Rebellion fought for. After less that thirty years the Republic they struggled and bled and died to restore fell apart at the first whiff of trouble. If's that's not a betrayal... 

I wanted to like this movie... I wanted to like the Force Awakens but I can't... its, it's, its... bad.

The way I look at it the prequels were a failing of execution not of story. The story was largely there, but how they brought it to life was flawed. If you look beyond bad dialogue and poor acting the Prequels are one of the greatest tragedies in fiction. Beyond the Tragedy of Darth Vader it was the fall of the Old Republic, the Republic that has stood for ten thousand years, as a beacon of light in the darkness, of civilization and the ideal that all the species of the galaxy can come and work together as equals. Is it perfect? No. No system or government is, but it was something truly grand. In the end the Republic was brought low not through barbarian invasions or outside threats but by the weakness of those who should have strengthen it. By the failings and the corruption of the organs of government to the blindness of its greatest guardians to perhaps worst of all to the apathy of the common people who allowed democracy to die. The story and the potential greatness is there behind the flaws; which is something I thought the existing EU now legends allowed to come to the fore.

The new trilogy, or at least the first two movies, are not good stories.",1, Josh H

"December 24, 2017","The original Star Wars movies were made for adults but kids loved the movies as well. The new Star Wars movies are made for kids and adults are an afterthought.

Sadly, this movie doesn't have any of the clever nostalgia or well thought-out storylines like Rogue One. It's like Disney had a checkbox of sequences they had to hit for this film and really didn't care if it made sense. In fact on many occasions the movie is just downright ridiculous. Unfortunately it looks like Star Wars has made a full pivot away from the old films and toward the world of Disney with Porgs, dim-witted politically correct characters, and oversimplified and unimaginative story lines.",2,
